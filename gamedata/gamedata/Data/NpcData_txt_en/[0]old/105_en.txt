Well, jolly good! We've got company! How I'm supposed to get any bloody work done is beyond me.

480:
Again. What a pleasure.

960:
Look, I have lots of work to complete, and it doesn't pay to lose my concentration at your every whim.

1440:
I don't presume to understand it at all, this war. But, I've got a job to do, and these interruptions aren't helping matters any.

1920:
Goodness, no.

2400:
These intrusions are unacceptable.

2880:
Be bloody careful now! There are compounds here that are, how shall I say, sensitive. It wouldn't bode well for ANY of us to be excitable in their presence. I hope I make myself clear.

3360:
No thanks. I am already doing my part.

3840:
Oh, bloody hell...

4320:
I can't waste more bloody time yapping it up with you.

4800:
Kind of you.

5280:
You bloody wanker!

5760:
What the bloody hell is going on here?

6240:
Uh, very well then, thank you.

6720:
Listen here. I don't have time for this.

7200:
Good Lord man! Look, I became the head scientist by diligent work, not by talking to people. Now, if you'll let me get back to my research. Thank you.

7680:
Oh, shut the bloody hell up! Good Lord man, I could kill you with any number of compounds. Now let me be.

8160:
Bloody hell! Do tell me, when I relate the story of this conversation to friends back home, would you prefer I call you "annoying" or "crazy"? Now, get away from me.

8640:
Bloody hell! That's it. I can't work under these conditions! She promised security, secrecy, and a workplace free of interruption. Right! Well, I am NOT giving my life for her promises.

9120:
You want her bloody weapons? Go ahead and take them, then! Just leave me out of it. I'm no less a hired gun than you! Follow me, I'll show you where they are. Then, leave me be!

9600:
You'll find what you want in those crates.

10080:
Have it your way. I don't have anything more for Christ's sakes.

10560:
How can I put this lightly. I'm not a part of this any more than you feel you are. We're just on different sides, but it's all about money, isn't it. Now, I've given you what you've come for. Leave me this small dignity.
