There's someone looking to die.

480:
This one's gonna die with surprise plastered across the face.

960:
Which one to choose?

1440:
I found something to shoot.

1920:
I found something to shoot.

2400:
Did you lose it for a minute?

2880:
I'm getting really paranoid.

3360:
I'm getting really paranoid.

3840:
I'm expierencing anxiety build-up. This area looks awfully suspicious.

4320:
Yeah. Right.

4800:
Which one to choose?

5280:
What's this?

5760:
I wonder who this belongs to?

6240:
I got no ammo, and I'm getting really paranoid.

6720:
This is it... I'm dying. So peaceful. So many colors...

7200:
Larry always was a little accident-prone. I might even miss him.

8640:
I was daydreaming and now... I'm confused.

9120:
This gun! Useless...

9600:
I don't scare that easily.

10080:
I felt rushed.

10560:
The nerve of this guy! Shooting at me.

11040:
I don't mind firing for nothing...

11520:
Oh neat. I'm bleeding.

12000:
I doubt I'll sleep tonight.

12480:
I have no energy.

12960:
It's such a let down when they finally die...

13440:
It's such a let down when they finally die...

13920:
The voice on that Sparky just drives me insane.

15360:
Hang on! I think he's still breathing.

15840:
You only made one mistake! Being here.

16320:
What a day. My!

16800:
Boring, boring, boring. I'm not spillng my fair share of blood.

17280:
Forget it.

17760:
You know what's strange? I can never remember how many people I killed.

18240:
I think I've just heard a fat lady singing.

18720:
Wait till your mom meets me.

19200:
If I was you, I'd start looking underneath my bunk.

19680:
I got a real hankerin'... to kill somebody...

20640:
This is a piece of useless junk. We should just chuck it.

21120:
Alright. You're my paycheck. Just don't tell me we're wearing yellow.

21600:
I like to kill. I even like to watch killings. But when I don't get to do enough of my own killing, I don't go back. Ever.

22080:
My old man wouldn't even let me light the barbecue.

22560:
He's crazier than me! I've gotta get out of here.

23040:
You're a loser.

23520:
If I, like... hear that, like... Sparky chick's voice again, I'm gonna, like, blow her freakin' brains out!

24480:
Larry's the man. He's almost gifted.

25920:
Your time is up. I've had it with you.

26400:
I'm gonna kill you! Then I'm gonna eat you! I'm gonna start with your ears. They're the best part when you know how to cook 'em. Crispy... not burned.

26880:
I'll never forget this.

27360:
Yeah. Just what was your point?

27840:
You know any women?

28320:
I'd never miss the chance to get in on a good shootin'!

28800:
Hang on. The job ain't done... till I say it's done.

29760:
It must be Christmas!

30240:
Loser.

30720:
I can't get out of this hellhole fast enough.

31200:
Everyone on that team... is dead.

31680:
I just love for somebody to try and get this off of us.

32160:
Did you lose it for a minute?

32640:
Dogs of war!

33120:
I find this whole mission thing... a real distraction. But now that it's done, we can go back to killin' people... right?

33600:
We can clean our guns now. Don't think we'll be seeing any more of them for a while.

34560:
It's time to go back.

35040:
I guess.

35520:
This is a piece of useless junk. We should just chuck it.

36000:
It's wired. But it's an amateur job.

36480:
We step in the wrong place - and it's ka-blooey!

36960:
What a rush! I'm about to drown...

37440:
If I don't spot something to shoot soon, I'm gonna shoot myself.
