I couldn't believe my eyes!

Body's been here for a while.

2880:
They don't call me "Ears" for nothing, you know.

I find the whole thing rather repulsive.

I can't recall an assignement ever being this quiet.

This area looks like trouble.

What a time to be outta ammo!

The pain... is unbearable... I need something... something for the pain.

Can't seem to find my way.

My weapon won't fire properly!

9600:
I'm coming under fire!

10080:
I'm exhausted. I've to stop for a second.

Someone just shot at me!

11040:
I haven't got much to shoot at.

11520:
I have a wound that needs attention!

12000:
It's getting late.

12480:
Can't seem to find my way.

12960:
Better you than me.

13440:
Better you than me.

15360:
It might be time to consider trade school! Or perhaps a degree in the arts!

15840:
Ah, should've been more careful.

16800:
We got the job done after all!

17280:
Hey! Wait a minute!

17760:
We've done it!

18240:
You have to love these piece of cake assignments.

18720:
I got nothing more to say to you.

19200:
Once was more than enough. Don't call me. Ever.

19680:
You just bought yourself one motivated mercenary.

20160:
I'm coming under fire!

20640:
I can't do anything with that piece of scrap.

21120:
I have a date. And god knows I haven't got one of those in a long time.

21600:
You may want to think twice about hiring Buzz Garneau. I hear she's with child. Seems... Lynx knocked her up.

22080:
Listen... I'm the best mole for the money.

22560:
I don't think we're gonna be able to get the job done.

23040:
You'd better get your act together.

25920:
You can't cover my cost.

26400:
I was hoping to see you again.

26880:
My eyes!

27360:
This is embarrasing!

27840:
It looks like we're dating steady.

28320:
I'm ready anytime you are.

28800:
That's quite a bag of losers you put together there, Commander Coward!

29760:
You're out of luck.

30240:
Lonely, eh? Tell me about it.

30720:
Perhaps if you gave me another chance, I could do better.

31200:
That's the last of that crew.

31680:
Made quite a profit off of us.

32160:
It's a shame.

32640:
Enemy present.

33120:
I was glad to be a part of it.

33600:
This sector should be under our control now.

34080:
Hang on a second.

34560:
Now...

35040:
Since you didn't hear me, I'll say it again.

35520:
I can't do anything with that piece of scrap.

36000:
Looks like a booby trap.

36480:
Ground looks like it's been camouflaged.

36960:
I'm exhausted. I can't find... strength to... stay afloat.

37440:
I've got it.
