19680:
Is this the best you can do?

20160:
This place is going to blow!

20640:
This thing's a piece of garbage! Doesn't anything work around here?

22080:
Consider yourself lucky...

22560:
Get your hands off me!

23040:
That can't be right!

23520:
Lookie, lookie! It's my loser brother, Larry.

She's DEAD?

32640:
Well well!

33120:
With me on your side, they didn't have a chance!

33600:
That's one group less.

34080:
Don't bother me anymore.

34560:
It's your lucky day. We're on!

35040:
I should have brought a book.

35520:
This thing is a piece of garbage! Doesn't anything work around here?

The ground looks suspicious.

36960:
I can't breathe... I'm DRO...WNING!

37440:
I'll have to get more specific directions!

38400:
I'd never join up with someone ? like you!

38880:
Forget this... You're not taking me serious enough.

39360:
You're a loser!

39840:
I'm outta here! You can't even get a decent haircut for that kind of money.

40320:
Well... Well... Busy, busy! I've got too many options. I'll join up with the team willing to put up the most cash, right now!

40800:
It wasn't that bad working for you. I guess if you need my services again you can call.

41280:
Get rid of my brother, pill-head Larry, or I'm ? out of here!

42720:
Your amount was matched. We'll go again. This time make me proud!

43200:
Fortunate for you, money is tight right now... So, I'll take it!

43680:
I'll join even though you don't deserve me!

44160:
I'm a little concerned. Mike says you're quick with the axe.

45600:
What about the money you already owe me? You give me three times what you you owe up-front and I'll go back!

46080:
Try listening...

46560:
You're stiffing a Roachburn! I thought you might want to be aware of that!

47040:
You stiffed a Roachburn, and now that I have the money... This Roachburn's stiffing you!

47520:
You're not even worth listening to anymore!

48000:
Get rid of my brother, pill-head Larry, or I'm ? out of here!

49440:
I'm a little concerned. Mike says you're quick with the axe.

50880:
Try listening...

51360:
Had you really wanted me, you would have bid a little higher. So, too bad!

51840:
I'm the best man for the job!

52320:
My father wasn't badmouthing me, was he?

52800:
I've got a bigger mouth than my father, and I'm a heck of a lot younger.

53280:
How you planning on paying me?

53760:
Don't bug me no more!

54240:
I don't work with my brother, 'anything but a placebo' Larry!

55200:
It's a good possibility. I'll need some time to weigh all my options.

55680:
You seem to be a little quick with the axe. I want double my regular salary!
