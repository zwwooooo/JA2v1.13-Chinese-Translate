¢æ ¢ç *** KNOW YOUR CHARACTER *** ¢ç ¢ç Can You Be Your Own Worst Enemy? ¢ç ¢ç How Can You Best Use Your Talents? ¢ç

1280:
¢æ ¢ç FIND OUT WHO YOU REALLY ARE AT ... ¢ç

1920:
¢æ ¢ç I.M.P. ¢ç ¢ç Institute for Mercenary Profiling ¢ç ¢ç http://www.I.M.P.com ¢ç

2560:
At IMP, we know the mercenary trade. We know the pressures you're under, and we know what it takes - advice you won't find at any candyass "pc" site. Our profiles are designed to elicit honest answers, accurate results and information you need to know. ¡À

3200:
¢æ Why you need us: ¢æ As professional armed "servicemen", you need psychological profiling (and sometimes counseling) to get ahead in your profession and to use your God-and-Smith-&-Wesson given talents to their fullest potential. IMP takes you there. ¡À

3840:
¢æ What you get: ¢æ IMP analyzes you scientifically. We look at your personality, your skills, your physical attributes ... right down to voice and portrait identification. You get a look at your character, an in-depth profile of who you are and what makes you tick (or get clocked). ¡À

4480:
¢æ How much: ¢æ WITH THIS SPECIAL EMAIL OFFER, you get it all for only $3,000! A savings of $2,500 off regularly advertised prices! ¡À

5120:
This is a *limited* offer by invitation only. ¢æ Your SECRET Activation Code: ¢æ XEP624 ¡À

5760:
Law Enforcement Agencies are requested to note that this is for entertainment only, and IMP does not (in any way that can be proven in a court of law - technically) supply actual mercenaries. ¡À

6400:
Good luck in Arulco

7040:
Due to your inexperience in the field I must ask you to be careful. Your success in previous confrontations convinces me that you're the right agent for this assignment. ¡À

7680:
Good luck, ¡À ¡À Robert ¡À

8320:
A *little* knowledge is a dangerous thing...

8960:
¢ç ¢æ *** HEY!!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? *** ¢ç ¡À ¡À ¢ç KNOW YOUR CHARACTER ¢ç ¡À ¡À ¢ç We already do! ¢æ ¢ç ¡À ¡À

9600:
At IMP, the Institute for Mercenary Profiling, we've already figured out that you're likely to pass up really good opportunities -- things that could make or break you out in the field. We know that you have a tendency to rush into things without checking out all possibilities. ¡À

10240:
You may also have a tendency to procrastinate. ¡À

10880:
FOR ONLY $3,000 we'll tell you a lot more about your character! ¡À

11520:
This is your last chance! (ok, not really, but pretend it is) ¡À ¡À Visit IMP now, and use your ¢æ SECRET activation code: ¢æ XEP624 ¡À

88320:
URGENT!

88960:
Accept my apologies, but I must recall you from your vacation. We have received a new assignment for you in Latin America. I realize you are currently involved in another field operation but I require your talents for a situational analysis. ¡À

89600:
You must arrive in Chile in two days. Instructions will be revealed on arrival. ¡À ¡À Robert ¡À

90240:
Following up

90880:
You are going to Arulco. It's a very small country in Latin America under military dictatorship. We've been receiving disturbing news from there for several years. Unfortunately, we have had too many problems with the Colombian Drug Cartel, so this country was not our primary focus. ¡À

91520:
Now the situation is critical, and we must directly intervene in Arulco's internal affairs. For more details reference the Reconnaissance Department report. ¡À ¡À Robert ¡À

92160:
Recon report

92800:
As you requested, please find the background information on Arulco in the attachment to this message.  ¡À ¡À yours faithfully, ¡À John ¡À ¡À <attachment moved to FILES area ¡À

93440:
Additional

94080:
The only way we see to solve this problem is a leadership change. We have contacted the so called "Government of Arulco in Exile" and believe that its head, Enrico Chivaldori, meets our requirements for a leader. ¡À ¡À Your primary objective is to contact the rebels in La Omerta. ¡À

94720:
Secondary objective is to determine what happened to the previously sent team - investigate town of San-Mona. ¡À ¡À As you know, we cannot officially support a coup. You will work with an independent organization called A.I.M. whose services we've used in similar situations. ¡À ¡À Robert ¡À

95360:
Mission became complicated

96000:
Your news has confirmed my worst fears. I believe the first team has been exterminated. It looks like there is an informer in the Agency. To prevent additional loss of data I shall stop further funding of your team through an agency account. ¡À

96640:
I contacted a friend and he suggested an alternative to funding the operation: by taking the export of ore into our hands. Your team is to take control of the small town La Chitsena to the west of where you landed. If successful, our friend will help us sell the ore overseas. ¡À ¡À Robert ¡À

97280:
Good news!

97920:
I'm very impressed! I knew you were the right choice for this delicate job. With the successful completion of this matters we are sure to get additional funding from Congress - they like success stories! ¡À

98560:
¡À Robert ¡À

99200:
Good news again

99840:
I see you are accommodated in Arulco. Considering the strength of the  opposition, I'm pleased to send you my congratulations on successfully completing the mission. ¡À

100480:
¡À Robert ¡À

101120:
Very good news

101760:
Congratulations! You are almost there! But beware, this Dictator may still have some tricks up her sleeve. ¡À

Good luck, ¡À ¡À Robert ¡À

Re: Temporary problems

Re: bad news

READ NOW!

119040:
Let me get to the point, I know you took MY money. You have 48 hours to show up at my house and give it back to me, personally. And you're to bring an extra 25 per cent to cover my aggravation. ¡À

119680:
If you don't, my men will track you down and kill you as though you were partridge. Just so we're clear; I had no trouble finding you now, and they'll have no trouble finding you later. ¡À

120320:
Waiting for your prompt visit, ¡À ¡À Kingpin ¡À

120960:
What's new?

121600:
I'm confused! Why are you so silent? Is there no progress to report? I understand it's a tough mission, but I must warn you - if you start a positional war you can lose the mission. There is nothing more demoralizing for good soldiers than being stagnant for an extended time. Waiting for news... ¡À

122240:
¡À Robert ¡À

122880:
What's new again?

123520:

124800:
WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?!?

125440:
Are you dead??? I'm furious at the lack of information! Do not even try to make excuses! I am in contact with rebels and they report that you are DOING NOTHING! ¡À

Well Hello There

129920:
It's me. John Kulba from Cleveland, Ohio. Just wanted to drop you a note to thank you for everything you've done. ¡À ¡À Can't tell you how happy I am to be back in the United States of America. A country with enough sense to never even have had a woman run for President. ¡À

130560:
I sent those guns I promised you off the other day. Sent them Express courier, so they should be in Drassen by now. Be careful with them. I made some modifications to those puppies - give ya a real bang for the buck. You'll want to make sure both your feet are firmly planted. ¡À

131200:
Anyway, you find yourself anywhere near the Gateway to the Great Lakes, you pop on in for a visit. I'll show you around. ¡À ¡À Thanks again, ¡À John Kulba ¡À
