0:
Enemies close!

480:
OK, let's do it - I wouldn't mind letting fly with a coupla knives..

960:
I shoulda listened to Mom.

1440:
I can see one of those things.

1920:
They look like....no, don't even think that...

2400:
Ohh, NOT a nice way to go.

2880:
I heard something there!

3360:
They stink like haggis - you know - the Scottish national dish? Better watch it beasties, otherwise I'll can you and ship you to Scotland...

3840:
This does not feel good.

4320:
Every time I turn around I imagine I see one of these horrible monsters in my face.

4800:
Hey, get me out of this...I'm at the wrong end of the food chain.

5280:
What 's that?

5760:
What is that?

6240:
Time to get more lead.

6720:
I need morphine...fast!

7200:
I have arrived. What do i need to do now?

8160:
That's a darn shame, Janno. I hardly knew you, but I always had a kinda good feeling when you were around...and you really liked the fine things in life too...damn...

8640:
What was I doin?

9120:
Even guns get scared...

9600:
Dirty bastards! It's gettin' pretty hot for me here.

10080:
Owww!

10560:
Wow, hi there adrenalin! Hoo,they tell me you can get hooked on this stuff.

11040:
I can't even see a target here...or am I supposed to be usin' heat-seekin' missiles?

11520:
I'm losin' too much blood - and I didn't even pack my iron rations...

12000:
I'm done...I'm gonna lie down for a while, ok?

12480:
No air...

12960:
Yeah!

13440:
Argh! They stink even more when they burst.

13920:
I can't be with that Red in the same fuckin¡ä team...he's got tinned haggis in his pack - barf!

14400:
This Numb guy is totally crazy! I think he drinks his own blood...yeah, I can just see him..slurping it up.

14880:
This Meltdown reminds me of my Aunt Lucia. A female supernova.

15360:
Sorry, Mike. It just wasn't your day.

15840:
Not..nice...

16320:
Cool it, Grace! Olive oil isn't fat...that's what my Aunt Lucia says, anyway.

16800:
Waiting for next command.

17280:
That..will.. not.. happen..!

17760:
She mighta been a snake, but she did achieve a lot..for a woman.

18240:
Ohh, my queasy stomach.

18720:
I just can't stand guys like that. You know... the kind who complains at mealtimes and can't even open a ration pack himself?

19200:
This is all so...depressing.

19680:
I'm surrounded by crazies - heh, almost reminds me of home.

20160:
Air attack!

20640:
The gear could be a lot better - I'm not used to crud like this.

21600:
These Scots are more macho than we Italians. Horrible...and the stuff they eat, yuch! Yeah, that's probably it... it's the slop they eat that does it!

22080:
This is gettin' to be fun...

22560:
From where I stand...not too cute.

23040:
Well, didn't expect anythin' else...

23520:
How can I possibly stand three days with that Red?..and what if he decides to stay on..and what if he's taken his stinkin' haggis with him as well?

24000:
That dummy Numb...here? Nooo...I must've done somethin' real bad. Maybe when I beat up the last guy my mother chose as a marriage candidate for me?

25440:
This Janno guy is ok. Reminds me of my little brother Alfredo.

25920:
Let's take a raincheck...I want to see how things develop.

26400:
Mamma Mia! Mike?

26880:
Aah, right in the eyes...Madonna, I'm blind!

27360:
I can see when something just won't work.

27840:
Nice, the people here...

28320:
Enemy presence!

28800:
There's still a few of 'em left...don't get careless!

29280:
What's this then?

29760:
A real sweet weapon!

30240:
That's him! Catch that boy! Be careful, tho'...he's just a child.

30720:
We'll support you...depend on it.

31200:
This sector has been neutralized.

31680:
Do they think we're so dumb, huh? Aren't we supposed to notice that there's stuff missin'?

32160:
Pity...there's not too many strong women around - shame she was led astray.

32640:
A...er...wildcat!

33120:
I'd call that a good day's work! Hey, I'll miss all this, you know...but maybe the next contract's waitin'...be good to be involved again.

33600:
The enemy has retreated, it would seem. Pansies...

34080:
I'm really beat...I can do more when I'm fresh.

34560:
Aahh, that's better! Let's burn some lead!

35040:
You took the words right out of my mouth.

35520:
I seem to have a small problem..with..this..thing..

36000:
That's one for the specialists...somebody's been playin' around here...

36480:
What's that on the ground? Looks suspicious...

36960:
I'm..going..down...

38400:
Nooo thanks. What I found out about you is soooo negative, friend.

38880:
There's a family reunion in Trenton next year - I wanna be there.

39360:
Uhh no...I have to take care of my nephews.

39840:
Sorry, I'm going on a further training course. Next time, don't wait until the very last minute before you decide to extend...

40320:
Grace Girelli here. Please leave a message. Mamma, if it's you...yeah, I'm fine...and no..I have no time at the moment and I'm NOT interested in meeting any nice young man...Ti amo...Ciao!

40800:
My contract's up...ok..time to leave.

41280:
And ol' Hairy Horrible Haggis is on the team too, huh? He is?...that horrible Red crud? Thanks, in this case, I think I'll decline.

41760:
That Numb has a couple of screws loose in his hard-to-find brain! He doesn't care if a mission turns into a horror trip...no, not our Numb! That's why he's here, he's makin' sure it WILL be a nightmare! No thankYOU.

42240:
What do they all call her? Oh yeah, Meltdown. Have you ever actually sat down and maybe reasoned out how she got the name? I can tell you from experience, it fits. Don't even ASK me to join you.

42720:
My contract's up...I'm interested, bello, if you are.

43200:
OK. Understood and accepted.

43680:
Very good...mission, here I come!

45120:
Well, I have my doubts..but...is it true that Janno is working for you? Yeah? OK, you can count me in.

45600:
I'm still workin' on gettin' over my bad experiences with you...

46080:
I said...

46560:
And just HOW do you expect me to pay my running costs? Nope, you can't afford me right now.

47040:
I'm not used to this, but, ok...I'm gone.

47520:
You know. I think bein' alive means a lot to me...if it didn't, I might stay.

48000:
That Red extols the virtues of his Scottish stink food the whole day long, damn haggis! As soon as we have a free minute, he starts up about the ingredients. Noooo, that's way too much for my sensitive Italian soul.

48480:
Nono, no kamikaze tactics thanks...when Numb's on a team, it just gets crazier'n'crazier. I don't care if he came up from the gutter...he probably didn't have it easy as a kid. But he...is...cra...zy!

48960:
I get big red spots all over my skin when I hear that Meltdown's voice. I'm sure you understand...I can't stay...for my health's sake.

50400:
My Mom would say '"Grace, are you-a crazy?"...and she'd probably be right in this case - but to be honest, I like working with Janno...so you got lucky. I'll stay.

50880:
I say again...

51360:
What, no cash? That's BAD if you're in the mercenary business.

51840:
Grace Girelli here.

52320:
Oh, by the way, I'm very good with knives...

52800:
I'm gettin' pins'n'needles from waitin'...

53280:
What kind of contract timeframe are we lookin' at here?

53760:
When you have even a rough idea what you need, call me.

54240:
I.. really.. cannot.. stand.. that Red...Scots pig. And he's so full of himself, he wouldn't even recognize the cold shoulder if it went up his ass! No way do I want to be in the same team as him!

54720:
With all due respect, it doesn't do your reputation much good when you hire psychopaths with fists for brains.You DO know who I mean, huh? I'm talkin' about Numb. I can really do without crazies like him, thank you.

55200:
Remember our contract will soon be expiring.

55680:
I work constantly on my skills - and it pays off. I mean that literally, by the way...
