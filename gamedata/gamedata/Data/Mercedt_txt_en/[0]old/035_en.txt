480:
What a shame. We'll have to do some killing.

960:
I have to get out of here!

1440:
Mutant trilobyte on the loose.

1920:
Mein Gott! It's like something prehistoric, something out of time, it's fascinating, and it's hideous, and I can't look away.

2400:
I don't think anything human could've done this... or any indigenous animal either, except perhaps those hypertrophic trilobytes.

2880:
I hear a noise. Can't identify it.

3360:
Phew, that must be the stench of the trilobytes.

3840:
I have a very ominous feeling about this place.

4320:
Let's hope we don't bump into any gigantic trilobytes.

4800:
How the hell do I overcome these things?

5280:
What have we got here?

5760:
Something here.

6240:
The chamber is empty.

6720:
Physician, heal thyself...quickly.

7200:
I learned much from you, Ice, and we are better people for having known you. In that way, you will live on. Godspeed.

7680:
Static, your good humor and youthful spirit helped see us through times of adversity. Those are precious gifts you have, and I will remember you always. Godspeed.

8160:
What an amazingly talented woman you were, Doctor Spider. Your grace under fire, your quick hands, your warmth. I can only hope to achieve that which came so easily to you. Godspeed.

8640:
What...what was I doing?

9120:
Gott im Himmel, my gun's not firing.

9600:
Have to find a better way to handle this!

10080:
Didn't even break a sweat.

10560:
Lucky to be alive. Good to feel that way once in a while.

11040:
There's hardly a shot from here.

11520:
This wound is too deep to stop bleeding on its own.

12000:
I'm so tired. Please, let me sleep.

12480:
Have to stop for a bit. Suffering a shortness of breath.

12960:
That one's kaputt.

13440:
Start fossilizing.

15360:
A shame to have to kill Mike... but he should have known better than to take the job.

15840:
Fragile, we are.

16320:
Rather not go in without my swimsuit and, I guess, I forgot to bring it.

16800:
What to do now...

17280:
I must refuse, no matter the consequence.

17760:
I like to think of her as permanently rehabilitated.

18240:
Just think. In a few hundred thousand years, she'll be petroleum!

18720:
Dummkopf!

19200:
I'd thought my spirit was unbreakable. But this misery is unbearable.

19680:
Mercs are not usually happy people, but this is the saddest, most neurotic team I've ever been part of.

20160:
They're flying in low!

20640:
What's the use of trying to fight when my guns and armor are so obviously inferior to that of the enemy?

21120:
Lighten up. We can have fun and get the job done at the same time.

22080:
I knew I'd gotten better!

22560:
This initiative sounds ill-formed and ill-timed.

23040:
That was an exercise in futility.

24480:
Ice is the kind of man I'm proud to serve with.

24960:
See, Static is a good soldier! And he makes me laugh.

25440:
This just confirms my impression of Spider. She is quite a woman.

25920:
Wait. Give me time to adjust and see if the chemistry works out right.

26400:
Ach du liebezeit! Mike is here! The schweinehund!

26880:
Ach du liebezeit! I am blind.

27360:
It is too bad, but it is too difficult for me.

27840:
Someone I would like to meet under different circumstances.

28320:
I have confirmed opposition activity in the area.

28800:
We must stay vigilant. Enemy forces remain in the vicinity.

29280:
I could make use of this...

30240:
That boy matches the description of the rebellious teenager we're supposed to be tracking down.

30720:
We accept your welcome and are eager to begin the task. Rest assured, Deidranna has indeed made a grave mistake in judgment.

31200:
Ja gut! Enemy defeated in this area.

31680:
Somebody, somewhere, has sticky fingers, and some of our stuff!

32160:
Even if the kids have to clean up the mess, I still say it was worth it. They will know freedom.

32640:
Mein Gott!

33120:
Next to the Berlin Wall, this is my greatest takedown! Thank you, friend.

33600:
The enemy has deserted the area. It is ours by default.

34080:
I will take my sleep now, and begin to work when I rise.

34560:
Yes, I am on the job.

35040:
You can say that again. Well, I can anyway.

35520:
This equipment has failed me. I am not surprised.

36000:
Mein Gott! This looks tricky!

36480:
Halt! The ground here reminds me of East Germany.

36960:
Mein Gott! I hate ... <gulb>... take... my gun... take.... anything...

37440:
Trip completed, I'm available.

38400:
I'll have to say no. I need a C.O. who inspires confidence, not caution.

38880:
Not me, no sir. I have an ex-wife and child to support, and your command tends to be deadly.

39360:
I haven't the time right now. I'm attending a seminar on the power of prayer in the healing process.

39840:
I have two marathons to run within the next week. So, while I can't take the job right now, I might be able to join you in the future. Try to let me know further ahead of time.

40320:
You've reached Thor, Cassandra, and Fenrus. We may be asleep or busy just now. After the tone, you can leave us a message, and we'll return the call as soon as we're able. Thank you!

40800:
Thank you for the opportunity. I hope we can work together again. Good luck.

42720:
When my contract expires a short time from now, will you want to keep me on as part of the operation?

43200:
I'll be glad to stay.

43680:
I'm looking forward to working for you.

44160:
Ice apparently thinks highly enough of you to be on your team. So, I think if you're good enough for him, you're good enough for me as well.

44640:
Static has a little more experience than I do in choosing teams. I'll trust his opinion of you and accept the assignment as he has.

45120:
I have a good deal to learn from Spider. I'd work with her under the worst of circumstances, and since she's with you, I suppose I'm with you, too.

45600:
I had thought this would be a good pairing, but I've come to realize I've made a mistake. But thank you for the opportunity.

46080:
Entschuldigung, I said...

46560:
With all due respect, sir, I can't pay the groceries with an I.O.U., and you don't have the cash to pay me.

47040:
I didn't realize I wasn't passing muster. But thank you for the opportunity to try anyways.

47520:
Not me, no sir. I have an ex-wife and child to support, and your command... tends to be deadly.

49440:
Ice apparently thinks highly enough of you to be on your team. So, I think if you're good enough for him, you're good enough for me as well.

49920:
Static has a little more experience than I do in choosing teams. I'll trust his opinion of you and accept the assignment as he has.

50400:
I have a good deal to learn from Spider. I'd work with her under the worst of circumstances, and since she's with you, I suppose I'm with you, too.

50880:
Pardon me, I said...

51360:
With all due respect, sir, I can't pay for groceries with an I.O.U., and you don't have the cash to pay me.

51840:
Hello, Thor Kaufman here.

52320:
I should let you know that as a vegetarian, I don't eat the regular tinned rations, but I can often scrounge myself a meal from the local flora. So, it's not as if I'd need any special supplies.

52800:
I need to get on with my life.

53280:
How long do you think you can use me?

53760:
Once you know what you need, call me. I'll be here.

55200:
A short time from now, my contract will be complete.

55680:
My performance is at peak, and I raised my fees to reflect that.
