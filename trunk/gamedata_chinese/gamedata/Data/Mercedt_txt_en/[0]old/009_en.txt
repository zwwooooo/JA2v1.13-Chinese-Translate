0:
Enemy ho!

480:
Enemies in sight. This means war.

960:
Game over, man, game over!

1440:
Big worm...

1920:
Holy Lucky Strike. That looks like the worm at bottom of tequila bottle... I would not like to see bottle.

2400:
What a mess. That worm has bad side.

2880:
I do not like sound of...whatever that sound was.

3360:
Ugh, the smell of worms...like broken wind.

3840:
There is trouble in air here. I wish I had brought vodka.

4320:
I have a sense that we're about to meet the worms...with none of usual pleasure.

4800:
This is like bad drunk I once had!

5280:
Something useful?

5760:
Object.

6240:
This gun needs ammunition.

6720:
I have been seriously injured... perhaps some whiskey would help and some vodka to clean the wounds?

7200:
Uncle Ivan... Aunt Natalia asked me to look out for your safety. What will I tell her now? I will have to make you proud of me. I drink to your memory, Ivan Dolvich, and I carry on your name.

7680:
Grunty... I have much admiration for you. A good soldier, a kind man... you should have been Russian, yes? I drink in your memory, Helmut Grunty!

8640:
Maybe I black out for a moment. What was I doing?

9120:
This weapon is jammed!

9600:
I must take charge of situation!

10080:
If this is best enemy can do, we have no problem.

10560:
I need foxhole.

11040:
I give no guarantee from this location.

11520:
Blood is spilling at my feet. This must stop.

12000:
Much fatigue. I must close eyes.

12480:
Unless I stop and catch breath, I shall become faint.

12960:
The enemy is cold.

13440:
I kill worm...

15360:
My uncle will be proud of me. He was not fond of this man.

15840:
Barbaric. As Tolstoy wrote, "War... what is it good for?"

16800:
This task is complete.

17280:
I must, in good conscience, refuse.

17760:
Haha! The drinks are on me!

18240:
Hahaha! Success! It is vodka time!

18720:
What a dishonorable, undeserving son-of-a-Cossack.

19200:
I have made bad choice. This is not job for me.

19680:
These soldiers are soft and not used to self-sacrifice.

20160:
Incoming enemies in flying machines!

20640:
These are not the weapons and armor of men. They are children's toys.

22080:
I'm from family of good learners.

22560:
This strategy does not appear to be reasonable one.

23040:
Given this amateurish plan, I am not shocked by results.

24480:
My uncle makes me proud to be a Dolvich!

24960:
Grunty is good enough to be a Dolvich, I think.

25920:
I will decide when the time comes. I have concerns about you.

26400:
That Mike is here. I dislike battling compatriots, but Mike is an enemy of the Dolvich's.

26880:
I feel like time when I get bad vodka in eyes. It is like fire on my face.

27360:
This task, you ask I do... I cannot complete.

27840:
This is someone I could share drink with.

28320:
We are in territory occupied by our enemies. I salivate in anticipation.

28800:
It is like our work is unfinished. Our enemies take cover under carpet.

29760:
Thank you! Thank you, very much!

30240:
It is that disrespectful boy...I believe.

30720:
Thank you. No Dolvich has disappointed. We will toast to days to come... ah, when we locate vodka.

31200:
All enemies are defeated and disgraced.

31680:
There are items missing in box.

32160:
Let us have drink to celebrate passing of this woman! This is great day for people, especially children!

32640:
Cujo!

33120:
Dolvich always succeeds. Let us drink! Vodka up, down and to the sides! To you, to friendship and to all our together times. A toast!

33600:
Our enemies retreat to safety. We are rulers of land.

34080:
I am not efficient. I sleep and rise soon.

34560:
I am awake and return to duty.

35040:
Yes. I join in this thought.

35520:
Right here, yes, I see clear now...it say "Crap" on label. It is ready for garbage!

36000:
Aha! This is trap of amateur!

36480:
Whoa... I do not like what I see on ground. And I no talk about dog droppings.

36960:
I... drink.... too much!

37440:
Yes, I occupy the destination of your choosing.

38400:
With my commanders, I have high expectations which, I am afraid, you do not meet. I am sorry to have to refuse.

38880:
Too many of those under your command return only in bits and pieces. I do not go to my death so readily. I must dismiss your request.

39360:
I am taking tour of American vineyards. I am sorry.

39840:
I apologize for my inavailability. I am opening small microbrewery in my home town. Tell me further in advance of your need next time, and I will try to accommodate you.

40320:
Welcome to the machine of Igor Dolvich. You leave me name and telephone number, and I will call you back to discuss it. Wait for noise of tone.

40800:
I am sorry we could not work together for longer time. Perhaps we will work together in future or at least share a drink, no?

42720:
I must alert you to the approaching conclusion of my contract. Should we discuss new contract at this point?

43200:
It pleases me greatly to update this contract.

43680:
I heartily endorse this contract.

44160:
I am always honored to serve wherever my illustrious uncle chooses to serve. I accept!

44640:
I defer to judgment of my friend Grunty who has been mercenary longer than me. He has accepted you, so I accept you.

45600:
I have been disappointed with the results of our partnership. I say no. Maybe we can discuss it again over beverages some day. Though I doubt this is possible.

46080:
I believe I said...

46560:
You barely have enough money to buy good bottle of Scotch, nevermind pay for my services.

47040:
I depart under protest as I believe you have not permitted me to display my talents to their best advantage.

47520:
Too many of those under your command return only in bits and pieces. I do not go to my death so readily. I must dismiss your request.

49440:
I am always honored to serve wherever my illustrious uncle chooses to serve. I accept!

49920:
I defer to judgment of my friend Grunty who has been mercenary longer than me. He has accepted you, so I accept you.

50880:
I believe I said...

51360:
You barely have enough money to buy good bottle of Scotch, let alone pay for my services.

51840:
This is Igor Dolvich.

52320:
I am sure you know of my uncle, the great Ivan Dolvich. Well, I am his nephew, then.

52800:
I know you are there.

53280:
What kind of contract do you require?

53760:
I am hanging up now. You can call me when you have decided.

55200:
My time here is almost completed. They prepare celebration at home for my arrival.

55680:
My uncle would be proud! I will soon be asking same price as the great Ivan.
