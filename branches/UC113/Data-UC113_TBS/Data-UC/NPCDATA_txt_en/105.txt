I understand you need information about the police.

My life is exciting enough here. Evicting drunks is about the most action I'm interested in. Thank you, but no, thank you.

Danubia's police are led by Commissioner Dragomir Woltz, a corrupt stooge of the Queen. You are in luck, amigos. A spy at police headquarters has hacked into his computer.

1920:
Thank you. Your generosity is welcome, but I have that already.

2400:
You may be lucky and find Dragomir on the roads. He often visits various police stations, travelling about in an armored limousine with an escort.

Help me stop this bleeding, then take me to the hospital! I feel faint at seeing blood, especially my own!

Goodbye, amigos. We need a decent police force to restore order. Hopefully, after Woltz is gone, someone honest will take over.

Police headquarters is in Adrian. Dragomir spends a lot of time there.
