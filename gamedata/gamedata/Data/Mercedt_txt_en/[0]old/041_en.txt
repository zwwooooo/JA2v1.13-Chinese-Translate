1920:
No way! Look at those big-ass worms... haha!

2400:
Twenty-to-one, those big-ass worms been here.

2880:
Either I heard something, or I got something in my ear again.

3360:
Pee-yew, I smelt it, but one of those worms musta dealt it.

3840:
Jeez, sumpthin' about this place got my Henrys in a knot.

4320:
I don't like worms. 'Specially not ones that got feet.

4800:
The worms are payin' me back for all those fishin' trips!

5280:
What's that thing?

5760:
Something over there.

6240:
My gun's feelin' light.

6720:
I'm screwed up bad... really bad.

7200:
Razor! Damn, you were so cool! I wanted to be just like you! I was workin' on it, I swear! Aw, this bites the big one.

8160:
Bummer, Numb. I was just gettin' to like you. You were psycho! Not as psycho as Razor, Razor's like TOTALLY psycho, but you were almost as good. Bummer.

8640:
Ummm...uh...come again?

9120:
Out of ammo! No, wait, no I'm not, my gun's jammed.

9600:
Jeepin' lizard, I'm about ready to kiss my ass goodbye here!

10080:
That was nuthin'. I'm all right.

10560:
Whoa! Thought my number was up.

11040:

11520:
Uh... how much blood can I lose before I have to do something about it?

12000:
Sack time for me, for sure.

12480:
I gotta slow down. I'm about to cough up a lung here.

12960:
Batta-boom, batta-bing!

13440:
Fish bait!

13920:
Aww, does widdle baby Biffy want his widdle bottle? I swear, what a pussy. Love to kick his ass.

15840:
Oh, that is wicked! I wonder if you have time to think, "Ouch."

16320:
Ever read about Vlad the Impaler? Awesome dude with the spikes? He's my hero!

16800:
I took care of business here.

17280:
Sorry, I ain't doing that.

17760:
If I'd been married to that bitch, I woulda killed her a long time ago!

18240:
Excellent! I'm gonna take some of her eggs home with me and do... some... ah, experiments...

18720:
I can't believe that jag-off!

19200:
I don't like this whole... thing.

19680:
This whole outfit blows chunks.

20160:
Bummer. Warplanes.

20640:
I can't do anything with this junk.

21120:
My last C.O. was a sonuvabitch. Wanna see his left ear? Hehehe, I took it.

21600:
I hate today's army. Too many immigrants who don't talk no good English.

22080:
I'll be boss in no time!

22560:
Looks like a pretty dumb setup if you ask me, and I'd know.

23040:
That wasn't supposed to turn out that way, was it.

23520:
I've had it with Baby Biffy's whining and crying. You can babysit him if you want, but I'm outta here. Good luck. You're gonna need it.

24480:
Yeah, Razor! You're my hero.

25440:
See, Numb, I believe in ya. Thanks for not making me look dumb. I hate that.

25920:
Hey, asshole. M.E.R.C. tells me you ain't payin' me. And since you get what you pay for, you ain't gettin' me. So long sucker. I'm history.

26880:
Shit, that burns! Gonna need one of 'em German Sheppard dogs.

27360:
It's like tryin' to get bacon out of your teeth. Impossible.

27840:
He's all right. But most of them are losers.

28320:
We've got losers around here.

28800:
I think I should start turning over rocks until I find every last one of 'em.

29760:
How do ya like them apples, roadkill!

30240:
Hey! It's Joey boy. Get me a broom handle. I'm gonna whack him upside the head just like my mum used to do.

30720:
Bummer. I was up for some good ass kickin', coulda done the job, too. I'm just gettin' warmed up.

31200:
Suckers! Nothing left to do but hold the funerals, or whistle for the vultures, hah hah.

31680:
Jeez, we got a problem here. Some loser took some of our stuff.

32160:
I won't be gettin' any more lip from her.

32640:
Whoa! Big-ass cat.

33120:
Yeah! Watch the heads roll! We are the coolest. You know, I'm asking for a raise, a BIG raise.

33600:
Yeah, the pussies backed out. Ain't no surprise.

34080:
Gonna hit the sack. I'm a loser without sleep.

34560:
Needed that. I'm up and on the job.

35040:
Put me on that list!

35520:
Jeez, do you buy everything with a coupon? This thing ain't worth squat!

36000:
Some stupid loser put a trap on this.

36480:
Ground looks funny. I ain't sending my ass airborne.

36960:
You pussies! Just let me drown...why don't ya!

37440:
Dragged my ass here. Now what?
