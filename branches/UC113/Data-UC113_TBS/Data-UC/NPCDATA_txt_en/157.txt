You one of those inspector guys from headquarters. Let me tell you right off the bat that I run the most technologically advanced plant in all of Danubia. 

480:
You stalking me? You know, I keep a log of everything you do, so watch your step.

960:
Here's the thing. Other plant managers They think they're better than me. Point is, I'm an innovative genius. Eventually those Crepaton gurus in Adrian will recognize that.

1440:
I still suspect bugs were planted by the other managers as part of a plot to subvert my obvious excellence. These guys are just itching to learn my methods.

1920:
No thanks. There's literally nothing you have that I need. Could use more raw materials though.

2400:
So, I been thinking. After the hostilities are over, I'm interested in hiring you guys to do a job for me. Keep it between us... I want to take over... the other plants.

2880:
You obviously don't know who you're talking to! Calvin Barkmore! Plant manager supremo and influential member in the crop circle believers society.

3360:
No, the last time I was recruited, it kinda pushed me over the edge. Anyways, I like to sample our medications... As a quality control initiative only, mind you. So you guys supply greenies to the grunts or not?

3840:
Ugh! That which does not kill me makes me stronger but shit, I need a doctor quick.

4320:
Well, I'm a busy man. Everyone wants a moment of my time, so I'll be going.

4800:
Say, you didn't plant any bugs in the office while you were doing that, did you?

5280:
Are you crazy? Do you know how many push-ups I can do? Just you wait. You're dogfood anytime soon man.

5760:
Oh, no... You're one of those mercenaries. I was in the Army once, full of dope-puffing dropouts. You probably heard of me, Calvin Barkmore, broke every record they keep track of.

6240:
I suppose, since you're in charge, you'll want the money. I guess it's possible to arrange diverting our income to your account. Which number? Errr.... I need to keep some for... uhhh... operating expenses. Is that OK?

6720:
I realize it's hardly believable, but we actually managed to produce so much Crepagen we ran outta raw materials. Unless you can arrange a shipment, supplies will dry up by week's end.

7200:
The plant's closed. It's an artsy-fartsy nightmare.

7680:
Come to think of it, where the hell have you been? You left me to single-handedly fend off an army. I had to do a Rambo and throw the whole lot of em through windows. Don't you ever pull that stunt again deserting us!

8160:
Do your job! Snuff the baddies, then maybe, if it's safe, we can chat about whatever takes your fancy. Me, I'm gonna hide in the dunny.

8640:
I know, you actually seem to be doing all right without me. But I tell you, if I had time and was on your team, I'd be in the palace by now. I'm not one to let things drag on.

9120:
No need to thank me. I'm quite satisfied working for my meager salary. I got everybody working faster and harder than any other plant. We're at maximum production.

9600:
You want things to go any faster, you'll have to convince more people to work here.

10080:
Naturally, seeing how there's no chemicals left, we're closed.

10560:
I had this coming to me. About time.

11040:
Plant closed.

11520:
Plant re-opened.

12000:
 

12480:
 

12960:
