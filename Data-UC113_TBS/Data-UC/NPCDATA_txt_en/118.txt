Oh! Thank God you've arrived! I'm Ambassador John Blair.  Certainly you must be here to rescue me?

480:
Well, I see you've finally come to your senses.  A little help would be appreciated.

960:
Yes, yes, I know.  Danubia and all its problems.

1440:
Yes, I know I shouldn't be here.

1920:
I really can't use that.

2400:
Really, I wouldn't mind at all if Elizabeth became, hmmmm... let's say, misplaced?

2880:
Really, I'm apalled! You certainly can't be a soldier of the Queen's Army.

3360:
I am a politician, not a barbarian.

3840:
Oh! Please! You must get me to a physician immediately! I'm much too important to die here...

4320:
Your primitive conversational habits are amusing.

4800:
I really can't use that.

5280:
Are you certain we're in the right location?

5760:
I say, ol' chap, our plane was shot down.  What sort of barbarian country would shoot down a civilian airliner?  I can only thank God I wasn't killed!

6240:
Oh, of course Elizabeth dear, I certainly did not mean to imply that my prayers were not with you as well.   

6720:
Please, tell me you can't find the key for her cell?  Just joking, Elizabeth dear.

7200:
Well, it was absolutely terrible.  We were separated from the pilot after he crash landed over by Calisto.  We were immediately arrested as spies, and brought here to this revolting prison.

7680:
Please, you must get us out of the country as quickly as possible. I'm certain your government understands the importance of my survival.

8160:
I simply cannot wait to get on that plane.

8640:
You're just a barbarian like the others.

9120:
It is absolutely wonderful being here, and ready to finally go back to civilization. Certainly, losing Elizabeth was a tragic mishap.  But then again...

9600:
Finally, we're here. I must inform you, when we were arrested, the MOC list I was instructed to deliver was confiscated. You must retrieve that disk at all costs!

10080:
Elizabeth dear, do we have anything you could possibly give to these fine soldiers?

10560:
Remember, the MOC list must be retrieved. Without it, you and all of your companions are in grave danger of being discovered.

11040:
I will put in a very good word for you when I get back to my superiors. Certainly you will be honored, even knighted by the Queen herself.

11520:
I'll be sure to put in a good word for you, ol' Chap.

12000:
I don't know if there are enough bandages to help Elizabeth, but, could you give it a try?

12480:
I'll be sure to put in a good word for you, ol' Chap.

12960:
Is Elizabeth all right?  It would be such a shame to have to bury her in this God forsaken country.

13440:
Don't you think it would be best for the gunplay to cease first?

13920:
Well, I must say, I was just a bit concerned about your methods of travel.

14400:
