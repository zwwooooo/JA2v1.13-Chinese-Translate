These fuckers are here - I can feel them.

480:
Time to load up.

960:
Looks like deep shit time.

1440:
There must be a fuckin' nest of these things here somewhere.

1920:
Last week at the Jap's place, I thought I saw my Sushi movin' on the plate - and that strange feelin' is back again... Hey, are you seeing the same thing as me?... this...mutant...fish thing?

2400:
Our mutant fish fucks have been here - if you don't want to be a fast snack for them...keep your eyes open!  

2880:
Ssh...hear that?...

3360:
At least you can 'smell' them comin': Those mutant maggots. 

3840:
The quiet before the storm...

4320:
I can feel those fucking fish eyes watching us...

4800:
You'll find me hard to get...Fish dicks! 

5280:
Something here?

5760:
Something lying there.

6240:
Have to reload...

6720:
I'm hit...badly...!

7200:
Laura, girl! Nooo...NO! Not you too....VERDAMMT...this should not be...

7680:
OK, Henning...dammit...you were the best...

8160:
C'mon, Grunty you can't just... give up and leave us like this!

8640:
What am I doing here?

9120:
Fuck it..jammed!

9600:
Looks they want me...a lot.

10080:
That was rough..

10560:
A close call.

11040:
That is laughable - shoot from here?

11520:
Hey, I'm bleeding...and it looks like a bad one - I need treatment.

12000:
Sleep helps now and then.

12480:
C'mon Rudolf...breathe!

12960:
Jaa!

13440:
Not moving a muscle...the pussy, hah!

13920:
I found that clown Gasket amusing at the start - now I need him like  I need itchy piles...

14400:


14880:
I'm here to do a fucking job...not get distracted by a stupid dum-dum like Bull!

15360:
Mike is history.

15840:
Thank fuck the dead don't care how they look...

16320:


16800:
I'm ready!

17280:
I will not carry out that order..

17760:
Someone should have done this years ago.

18240:
Maybe Greenpeace would cry murder - I fuckin' won't.

18720:
Fucking asshole.

19200:
All this crap...it makes no sense anymore.

19680:
The others should really pull themselves together - we will fail if they  don't...

20160:
Air attack!

20640:
Maybe we should pass our equipment over to the enemy...it would be a  brilliant strategical move - then THEY would have all this fucking useless crap to work with.

21120:
These people still have very much to learn...and the first thing  is to move their fucking asses!

21600:


22080:
Sometimes my sheer quality surprises even myself...

22560:
That MUST be a joke, ja? Nooo,...you're serious...you really mean it...

23040:
What can I say? I knew it was a shitty plan.

23520:
That guy there, ja, that Gasket...He is a total fuckin dickhead... Tell me he is here by accident or it's just a coincidence...PLEASE!

24000:


24480:
Laura does everything right...what a girl!

24960:
Respect. Those military East Germans were good.

25440:
I LIKE that Helmut Grunther...did you all see that?

25920:
Seems a bit too soon to me.

26400:
Fucking Mike..????

26880:
Everything's dark...I can't see...!

27360:
Cannot be done.

27840:
Nice people here...you just have  to treat them right - THAT'S the important thing...

28320:
Achtung!! Enemy - fuckin kill them all!!

28800:
No relaxing..we haven't got all those fucks yet.

29280:
What's that?

29760:
Good gun.

30240:
That's Joey - catch him!

30720:
We are here to solve the problem. There will be no problem.

31200:
We've cleaned up here pretty good.

31680:
There are things missing here - somebody's trying to fuck us over.. But he'll regret it, whoever he is...because when I find out who it was, I'll make him eat his own dick with mustard!

32160:
She was a dumb bitch anyway...

32640:
A big cat!

33120:
It was a well planned out mission - in every way. I hope that this has helped this country...and the world.

33600:
We seem to be on our own...maybe the enemy's pulled back  to have a think about strategy.

34080:
I must get some sleep - now.

34560:
I'm ready and willing!

35040:
Me too.

35520:
This thing's kaputt!

36000:
Careful! This reminds me of a booby trap.

36480:
Achtung, something on the ground there!

36960:
...Fish fuck in it...and I drown in it...(gurgle...)

37440:
I'm here. Waiting for orders.

37920:


38400:
I only ever work with good people, ja? And I have NO reason to believe that you belong to this category.

38880:
I'm not sure if all these deaths in your teams are necessary... and it looks to me like you don't even fucking care...that is not the way I work.

39360:
No can do right now...I have to take my dog to the vet.

39840:
Keeping all your options open until the last minute, ja? That's one sure way to get me to say Auf Wiedersehen... Next time, ask me sooner.

40320:
This is Rudolf Steiger. Leave a message - maybe I'll call back.

40800:
My role here is over - I wish you luck.

41280:
You're asking me to join you? And you've already hired that fuckhead Gasket? Noooo...my mother always told me that pros and fuckheads don't work well together...Lecken.

41760:


42240:
I'm the kind of guy who learns from his mistakes - and me and Mr. Fucking Bull on the same team will NEVER happen again.

42720:
Are you interested in extending my contract? I would be...

43200:
Here's to continued successful cooperation...

43680:
Fine, I'm on my way.

44160:
I don't mind passing the time of day with my baby - it's always a  big plus when you have Dr. Laura Colin on your team...and you are  really going to need a lot of damn big plus points for this..kamikaze job.

44640:
You managed to hire Henning - that surprises me, I must say... he's an absolute pro. OK, if he's on the team, you can count me in, too.

45120:
God knows how you persuaded Helmut Grunther to join you - but you did. I'm with you - I would like to work with him.

45600:
Do you really think I would join you after that last mission? Fuck off!

46080:
I said...

46560:
I don't like for little fucking farts...but POOR little fucking farts? Auf Wieder-fucking-sehen!

47040:
You and I both know that this is not right - but I will leave now.

47520:
Your death rate is too high - you treat your team like your morning shit - you push it out and forget about the fucker...

48000:
Dickhead sickness runs in Gasket's family - but in his case? it fucking gallops.

48480:


48960:
If you like fucking dumb gorillas and brainless slaughter, Bull is your man... but you'll have to do without me on your team...

49440:
Laura and I will soon be celebrating an anniversary  ...with her by my side, I will even take on this...risky mission...

49920:
I like to watch Henning work. He is truly one of the elite pros -  and because of him, I am interested in extending my contract - in spite of my doubts about this mission.

50400:
Helmut Grunther can take a difficult mission and make it look easy - he is the reason why I'll stay on...but put this on the record...  this mission sucks.

50880:
I said...

51360:
Hey - what does PFF mean? Aah, are you curious? It means...Poor..Fucking.. Fart...is the message coming through loud and clear?

51840:
Hello...

52320:
I have better things to do... 

52800:
Do you want me to just soak up the sunshine?

53280:
How long should the contract run?

53760:
Call me when you KNOW what you want...

54240:
Fucking Gasket? He was on a mission with me some time ago... I'm amazed the psycho dickhead is still alive...he nearly got us all killed and that is NOT, I repeat, NOT an experience I wish to relive.

54720:


55200:
Remember - my contract is running out.

55680:
I have perfected my skills - sould this not show in my pay packet?
