0:
I have visual contact.

480:
See one! My position unknown.

960:
Multiple sightings!

1440:
See one! 

1920:
See one! 

2400:
Show your face, liver-belly!

2880:
I'm clueless over here...

3360:
Show your face, liver-belly!

3840:
You're way off! And way out of line to boot!

4320:
Let's pay attention!

4800:
Multiple sightings!

5280:
Located something.

5760:
Located something.

6240:
I've depleted all my ammo.

6720:
I have major injuries... Need attention immediately...or I'm gonna...die!

9120:
My piece misfired!

9600:
Being shot at! Like that's never happened to me before...

10080:
I'm getting clobbered!

10560:
I'm used to it...

11040:
It's an abnormal request, but who I am to question it.

11520:
I need some time out to patch-up.

12000:
Once you learn how to sleep on your feet, you can stay up all night.

12480:
I'm short of breath.

12960:
Get a hold of yourself!

13440:
Killed!

13920:
What's with this Raffitto?! He's a nutball! Fire him! Kill him! Just do something with him before he tries to take a scalpel to me!

15360:
Somebody write the family...

15840:
Massacred!

16800:
Mission accomplished!

17280:
That'd be pointless.

17760:
Somebody write the family...

18240:
Killed!

18720:
He's a screwball!

19200:
It's a tempting proposition...

19680:
I thought I followed procedure.

20160:
Don't break out the champagne just yet, hotdog!

20640:
It's not useable.

21120:
Get with the program! We kill people for a living! Do you think stealing is beneath us?

22080:
Stay that way!

22560:
After wearing that blue helmet for nine years, today I actually get to kill something... You!

23040:
You're perfect material for the peacekeepers. Heck, they'd probably make you a commander.

23520:
With a set of hair like that, it must be Raffi. He's a screwball!

25920:
I got nothing to sight up.

26400:
This was a short stint, buddy! Too short!

27360:
It's nailed down!

28320:
Let's pay attention! It looks like pressure triggers might have been planted around here.

28800:
Let's pay attention!

30720:
There never seems to be enough time, does there?

31200:
It feels great to actually win something!

32160:
Killed!

32640:
See one! 

33120:
It's a privilege to serve under you.

33600:
All of that company's been accounted for!

34080:
I goofed.

34560:
It's workable.

35520:
It's not useable.

36000:
Deactivating it might be too complex for me!

36480:
Deactivating it might be too complex for me!

36960:
I can't continue... Can't swim any further...

37440:
We got what we came for.

38400:
I have to say no! Your casualty record is worse than the peacekeeping force I was assigned to... And your guys are allowed to fire back!

38880:
This is worse than anything I've ever witnessed working as a peacekeeper. We're getting massacred! Don't look for me anymore.

39360:
I have to say no! You've made far too many personnel changes. Something I feel reflects upon your leadership.

39840:
You'll have to increase your contribution if you want to stay in the running.

40320:
I'm sorry, but those infernal moving men have yet to show. The woman on the phone tells me they're en route but I have my doubts.

40800:
You weren't the only offer. If you still intend to hire me, you're going to have to suggest some sort of cash enticement.

41280:
I've spent a mission with that nutball, Raffitto. I won't even think about rejoining until he's no longer a member of your squad!

42720:
I'll need to see proof that you can gather up the money to pay me. Having it is the best proof I can think of.

43200:
You're my only offer, so I'm hitching up.

43680:
If you're my only offer, then I'm yours.

45600:
This is worse than anything I've ever witnessed working as a peacekeeper. We're getting massacred! Don't look for me anymore.

46080:
It's like I said...

46560:
Somebody else came up with a better suggestion.

47040:
It's too bad. I would have liked to sign up, but I'm in the process of moving.

47520:
This is worse than anything I've ever witnessed working as a peacekeeper. We're getting massacred! Don't look for me anymore.

48000:
I've spent a mission with that nutball, Raffitto. I won't even think about rejoining until he's no longer a member of your squad!

50880:
It's like I said...

51360:
I gave you my full attention. I can no longer afford to do that.

51840:
I can't wait for the chance to actually discharge my weapon.

52320:
At the price you paid for it, it better be guaranteed for life and have some gold content.

52800:
You've never hired anyone as eager as me. I've had to lay low and watch for far too long.

53280:
Your suggestion was the best of the lot. I'm signing on with your squad.

53760:
I've already given too much of my attention to your poor attempts at bribery.

54240:
Offing Raffi can only make battlefield safer for all of us!

55200:
I guess even the best of things have to come to an end.

55680:
I'm use to six months stints. The last time I worked for you I didn't even get a chance to go to the john. Forget it!
