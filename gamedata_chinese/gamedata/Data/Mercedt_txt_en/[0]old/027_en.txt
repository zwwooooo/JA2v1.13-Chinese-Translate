Enemy presence.

480:
Bear down for action.

960:
Gotta find a way out of this.

1440:
Another elephant bug, sir.

1920:
I have to confess, this is a new type of warfare for me, sir.

2400:
We're going to have to do something about those things.

2880:
Pay attention! I heard movement.

3360:
I smell the elephant bugs.

3840:
I have an uneasy feeling, sir.

4320:
Got bad vibes. Has the look of an elephant bug habitat.

4800:
These sci-fi bugs are determined to get me.

5280:
Item.

5760:
Located something.

6240:
Ammo required.

6720:
Bleeding profusely... I require... urgent treatment.

7200:
I've been through many battles with Vicki. This is indeed hard to accept. She even went out of her way to get me parts for my car... at a substantial discount.

7680:
The Major has been a friend for...for quite some time. He will be missed dearly. I believe some revenge is in order!

8160:
Dr. Q. has left us. He was an exceptional man with a first name no one could pronounce. His presence shall remain in each of us.

8640:
Require assistance, sir.

9120:
Weapon's jammed.

9600:
Under suppression fire!

10080:
I'm gettin' a little too old for this.

10560:
Got lucky.

11040:
I haven't got a clean line.

11520:
I'm wounded.

12000:
I will require shut-eye, sir.

12480:
My age, it's taking its toll.

12960:
That's better!

13440:
One less!

13920:
It would be a privilege to reunite that whacked-out Reuban with his family!

14880:
Anybody who cuts their hair like Numb is a renegade. He's got 'bad attitude' written right across his scalp and hanging from his ear. I don't like it one bit.

15360:
He's no longer the legend he once was.

15840:
No matter how many times you see it, it still makes an impression.

16800:
Available for reassignment.

17280:
I won't do that, sir.

17760:
Most satisfying.

18240:
I hope it's incapable of giving birth after it's dead. I mean...it's not like one can acquire that kind of info anywhere, sir.

18720:
Quite the piece of personality.

19200:
I've had a long career, but this truly feels like my longest assignment.

19680:
Quite the band of professionals you've managed to assemble, sir.

20160:
Heads up!

20640:
No offense intended, sir, but the Army wouldn't pass out this kind of inferior equipment to the new recruits at boot camp.

21600:
There are some here, sir, that could learn a thing or two about treating a lady with respect.

22080:
This old dog learned a trick.

22560:
No offense but have you thought this one out to its conclusion, sir?

23040:
Quite expected, sir.

23520:
Reuban?

24480:
Good to have you around, Vicki.

24960:
Lightning heave-hoe.

25440:
Dr. Q. never fails to impress.

25920:
I'd like to shelve that proposition for a little while, if that's all right with you, sir.

26400:
Mike signed up with the wrong side.

26880:
I'm lacking visuals, sir.

27360:
I'm wasting my time, sir.

27840:
A rather friendly people, wouldn't you say...

28320:
Should exercise extreme caution. We have a confirmed enemy presence, sir.

28800:
We have unaccounted for stragglers. We should proceed with caution, sir.

29760:
A good weapon can save your life, sir.

30240:
Do believe we've located the AWOL boy, sir.

30720:
We'll do our best to stop her. You can count on it.

31200:
Enemy presence terminated, sir.

31680:
Our order has not been properly filled, sir.

32160:
That was extremely gratifying. I am certain anyone who knew her will be grateful.

32640:
Feline, sir.

33120:
I guess I thought I was getting too old for this, but each time I win one, it reminds me of why I joined A.I.M. way back when - for the chance to make a difference in the lives of others. And we did, sir.

33600:
They left, sir. The odds left them no choice.

34080:
My performance is slipping. I'll get some sleep.

34560:
Refreshed and back to work, sir.

35040:
That's exactly what I was thinking.

35520:
No offense, sir, but this has seen better days. It's inoperable.

36000:
Not a good idea. Looks hazardous, sir.

36480:
The ground looks highly irregular there, sir.

36960:
I'll try... to stay <glub>... afloat... sir.

37440:
Excursion complete, sir. Awaiting further orders.

38400:
I'll pass on the opportunity. The word about you is not good, sir.

38880:
My age, my experience, and my standing allow me to be choosy. Your attrition rate is simply unacceptable.

39360:
Sorry, but there's some outstanding issues that I have to deal with. Just downright poor timing, sir.

39840:
I promised the wife I'd spend some time with her. Confirmed it just a couple of hours ago in the letter I sent her. Sorry.

40320:
Corporal Len Anderson is indisposed momentarily. If you would like me to call you back, please leave a message. Thank you!

40800:
I wish you and the team the best, sir.

41280:
Unusually Ruthless Reuban has given this business a bad name! I won't work beside him!

42240:
I've already spent enough time in Arulco with Numb. We'll just leave it at that.

42720:
Would this be a convenient time to discuss your intentions? You do realize my contract will be ending shortly.

43200:
Fits into my plans perfectly, sir.

43680:
Consider me a part of the team.

44160:
Not that your leadership isn't without its problems, however, working with Vicki does allow me to cut you some slack.

44640:
I'm hesitant, but I haven't spent any time with Spike Scallion since our vacation last winter. Maybe, while I'm there, we can make plans for this year.

45120:
In the short time I've known Dr. Q. he has proven himself to be an exceptional soldier and a master of medicine. It would be a pleasure to work with him again.

45600:
Each day working for you feels like a lifetime. It suffices to say, I'm anxious to get out of here.

46080:
I repeat...

46560:
I would appreciate it if you check your funds before offering me employment. I can't describe the let down of thinking I've got a job, and then finding out there's no money to pay me.

47040:
A change of plans, sir? I understand.

47520:
My age, my experience, and my standing allow me to be choosy. Your attrition rate is simply unacceptable.

48000:
Unusually Ruthless Reuban gives this profession a bad name! Get rid of that animal, or I'm leaving this place!

48960:
I've already spent enough time in Arulco with Numb. We'll just leave it at that.

49440:
Not that your leadership isn't without its problems, however, working with Vicki does allow me to cut you some slack.

49920:
Spike would have been happy with a single mission.

50400:
In the short time I've known Dr. Q. he has proven himself to be an exceptional soldier and a master of medicine. It would be a pleasure to work with him again.

50880:
I repeat...

51360:
I would appreciate it if you check your funds before offering me employment. I can't describe the let down of thinking I've got a job, and then finding out there's no money to pay me.

51840:
Corporal Len Anderson at your disposal.

52320:
I'm in great health for a man with my experience.

52800:
I am expecting other calls.

53280:
And the time frame would be what exactly, sir?

53760:
Sorry, but that's all the time I could spare. Goodbye.

54240:
You can hire whoever you want. Though there are members who won't think much of you if you hire that butcher, Reuban. And I happen to one of them.

55200:
My tour of duty draws to a close, sir.

55680:
Respectfully, the more talent I have, the more I am worth, sir. A higher fee for my services is indeed warranted.
