Snapperheads.

480:
Our guests are here.

960:
This is when I'm at my best.

1440:
Need a broom!

1920:
Bet that'd make a crunch if you stepped on it, man.

2400:
Roaches got some appetite.

2880:
Hush up! Heard something.

3360:
Hoo-wee... haven't smelled nuthin' that bad since the days I shared a room with my sister, man.

3840:
Bring it on. I want to kick some ass.

4320:
Roach zone. Take your spray cans off safety.

4800:
This ain't nuthin', man. My aunt had a couple of these behind her freezer.

5280:
Over there.

5760:
Got something.

6240:
Chamber's empty, man.

6720:
Pissin' blood, man!

7200:
Blood bit it? Big time downer, man.

7680:
If Ice is dead, hell musta froze over.

8160:
I got a score to settle with the snapperhead that killed Jimbo!

8640:
Brain fart! Lost it, man...What was happenin'?

9120:
Piece is screwed!

9600:
Your ass is on my platter, snapperhead!

10080:
Trying to impress me?

10560:
I don't sweat the close ones.

11040:
How am I supposed to hit that, man?

11520:
Got a skin puncture, man.

12000:
Couple of big Z's do me some good.

12480:
I need to chill.

12960:
So long, Snapperhead!

13440:
End of the road, roach.

13920:
That uppity bitch grates me, man... Keep Buns outta my hair.

14400:
Marty... Come see how clean my gun is.

14880:
Bubba's a racist good ol' boy. Keep him close to me, and you'll be pulling him out of a tree.

15360:
Here's a family name for him--Mike Gonnabecoldsoon!

15840:
It'd be cool if there was a replay or something. Kinda like to see it again in slow-mo, like a couple of times, man.

16800:
I'm through here.

17280:
No flippin' way, man.

17760:
The bitch is dead!

18240:
Mama roach is history!

18720:
Got a real winner here.

19200:
Not saying things are boring or anything, but just how many shopping days are there 'til Christmas, man?

19680:
What a bag of misfits I find myself in, man.

20160:
We got bad birds headed our way.

20640:
This is training school crap I'm getting, man.

21120:
What is it with these people, man...snapperheads, every last one of them.

21600:
Don't ask me why, but the Danish just piss me off.

22080:
I'm in tune.

22560:
There's a cokehead idea.

23040:
Could have taken bets on that.

23520:
Why did you bring that stuck-up Buns Sonderguard down here? I know just what she needs! You'd better get her away from me!

24000:
You gotta appreciate this... It's that tool, Kaboom!

24480:
You be blood, Blood!

24960:
The Iceman breaks through, again.

25440:
Jimbo... Man... Tell 'em Magic sent ya!

25920:
Chill. We'll talk soon.

26400:
That hotshot Mike took a job with 'em. He's gonna pay just like the others.

26880:
Burnin', man. I'm like seeing nuthin'.

27360:
I'm spinnin' my wheels, man.

27840:
That was one of the few people I met down here that wasn't a snapperhead.

28320:
Snapperhead alert! Hope everyone got the message!

28800:
We got strays. Might circle back on us.

29760:
Ya gotta like that!

30240:
I should have known we'd run into that kid here. This is where I'd hangout.

30720:
Thanks, man. You chill, and let me go throw a little party for them snapperheads. Already got their presents picked out. Engraved the stones and everything.

31200:
Every last one of them. Checked out permanently!

31680:
I think someone's done their shopping in our box, man.

32160:
One snapperhead less. That one was for the kiddies.

32640:
Think of the litterbox, man.

33120:
Time to chill out and relax. No more snapperheads breathing down our necks. You need me again, man, it'd be a pleasure. Here, take my beeper number, but don't let it out.

33600:
They must have headed to a snapperhead party in another sector.

34080:
I need to catch some "z's". Like now.

34560:
Magic's back on the job.

35040:
Count me in.

35520:
This isn't working, man.

36000:
Hold up. This thing's got a surprise.

36480:
Watch your ass, man. Things don't look right around here.

36960:
Hey, man, my ass... is draggin' bottom here...

37440:
Like lightnin', man. I'm here and ready to strike.

38400:
Not gonna happen! I can afford to be picky, man... And I ain't picking someone with your pathetic record.

38880:
You gotta be nuts! Place is like cadaver-central. Look elsewhere!

39360:
It don't look good, man. I'm booked up solid.

39840:
Not possible, man. Got to get back and take care of a few things. Ya shouldn't leave this kinda stuff to the last second.

40320:
Magic ain't here right now. You know what to do, so do it.

40800:
I thought I could drag this out a bit... guess not. That's cool.

41280:
As long as that chick Buns is part and parcel of the scenery, you can forget about me being at the party.

41760:
Kaboom should be in a home! I ain't going anywhere near him!

42240:
Bubba is a bubblehead, man. A white bread, snapperhead! I ain't gonna be in the team photo. As long as he's in Arulco, don't look for me.

42720:
We got business. You extending, or what?

43200:
We gonna be seeing some more of each other.

43680:
Looks like I got a plane to catch.

44160:
I got a couple of problems working with ya, but having Blood on your team is gonna put 'em aside for now.

44640:
Ya signed the Iceman, ya signed me.

45120:
I ain't happy with way you been doing business, but I hear Jimbo's workin' for ya! And I'd like to hang with him before he gets locked up again.

45600:
The whole episode was a deep downer, man... Maybe after a couple days of Prozac, we can talk... but don't count on it.

46080:
Melt the wax! I told ya...

46560:
We got a problem. No... you got a problem. Ya might want to do business with that half-assed MERC outfit. Hear you don't need money to hire those clowns.

47040:
Shoot, man! I just got my bags unpacked.

47520:
You gotta be nuts! Place is like cadaver-central. Look elsewhere!

48000:
As long as that chick Buns is part and parcel of the scenery, you can forget about me being at the party.

48480:
Just cause Kaboom had his brains blown by a bomb doesn't mean the rest of us have to work with him! I want him gone, or I'm leaving!

48960:
Bubba is a bubblehead, man. A white bread, snapperhead! I ain't gonna be in the team photo. As long as he's in Arulco, don't look for me.

49440:
I got a couple of problems working with ya, but having Blood on your team is gonna put 'em aside for now.

49920:
Ya signed the Iceman, ya signed me.

50400:
If you're talking to Jimbo let him know he should stay away from my phone and my place. The cops got it staked out again.

50880:
Melt the wax! I told ya...

51360:
We got a problem. No...you got a problem. Ya might want to do business with that half-assed MERC outfit. Hear you don't need money to hire those clowns.

51840:
Magic.

52320:
When I work for you, I'm all there, man. Stuff gets done.

52800:
What's the deal? Ya on another line or what?

53280:
I can cut you some slack on a long-term deal, if it's good for you.

53760:
Whatcha think? Your face is worth staring at? I got a TV, man... think I'll go see what's on. Later!

54240:
I'll go, only because it's a big country. But ya keep that Danish prune, Buns Sonderguard, outta my face.

54720:
Just cause Kaboom had his brains blown by a bomb doesn't mean the rest of us have to work with him!

55200:
Our deal is closing up, man.

55680:
I go up, man, and so do the dollars. You know what I'm saying? Show me the money.
