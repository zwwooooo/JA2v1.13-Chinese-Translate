Breeham Druz. Everyone calls me Shank.

480:
How you doing? Thanks to you, I'm doing a lot better.

960:
It's gonna be nice to be able to sleep through a night.

1440:
It was like God sent you. You can't believe how grateful I am.

1920:
Freeing me was enough. You keep it.

2400:
Promise me you'll see to it that Deidranna suffers.

2880:
I told you everything. I swear!

3360:
It's not that I don't want to. I'm just not much of a soldier.

3840:
I can't deal with this. The pain's... painful.

4320:
I need time alone.

4800:
I'd appreciate the money you still owe me. Until then, I haven't really got much to say to you.

5280:
Money's always good.

5760:
Gettin' back at those responsible for putting me in Tixa? Sounds like a decent proposition to me. I'll try not to get in the way.

6240:
This is kinda awkward, but do you think you could spare twenty bucks a day, just so I'm not moochin' off everybody? I'm a pretty damn good knife thrower. Used to even do it blindfolded just for kicks at parties.

6720:
All right! Now what can I do for ya?

7200:
You must be part of that group of mercenaries we've been hearing about. Ya guys are going save our country, I know it... You've already saved me.

7680:
Gordon has lost his mind. They beat that poor guy to a pulp, then let him recover enough so they could beat him again. It's best to just leave him alone.

8160:
I consider myself lucky. I only spent a couple of days in Tixa - which is nothing compared to Dynamo Duncan. He's an oldtimer. Don't know how he survived.

8640:
You want to know why I'm in Tixa? Because of my parents. Turned me in for growing a couple of plants. They're rich, and they're friends with the Queen. Just like everyone else who lives in Balime.

9120:
I hate them! All of them! Got their wealth from the suffering of others. I'd think nothing of killing 'em. That goes double for my old man and old lady.

9600:
I heard some shooting. Is everything okay?

10080:
Let me know when everything's okay...

10560:
A lot of people are sure going to be surprised when they see me around again.

11040:
Jeez! Do you know how little twenty bucks gets ya? Ah, well... Have it your way.

11520:
You ruthless son of a dog.

12000:
You get me to Estoni and I could probably make some arrangements to get some fuel. Don't know if it interests you, but it's a thought.
