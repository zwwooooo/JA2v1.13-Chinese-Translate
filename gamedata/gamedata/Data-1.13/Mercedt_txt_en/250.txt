The punk's got me sighted.

480:
Got a tuned up twerp here junior.

960:
These punks are all over the place.

1440:
The punk's got me sighted.

1920:
Now I've met them all.

2400:
That's it, get the old guy to do the dirty work.

2880:
I'm sure I heard something.

3360:
We've come too far.

3840:
That's it, get the old guy to do the dirty work.

4320:
Can't let nothing stand in our way junior.

4800:
These punks are all over the place.

5280:
I'm sure I saw something around here.

5760:
Look junior.

6240:
I need bullets now junior!

6720:
My life's flashing before my eyes junior and it's flashing quickly...

7200:
Pops McGillicutty is dead? God. We've fought a lot of battles together. I'm sure he would've wanted to go out this way.

8640:
Where was I going again?

9120:
This is suicidal! My gun won't fire!

9600:
The punk's trying to take me down!

10080:
That's it junior. I'm retiring.

10560:
Thank my lucky stars.

11040:
I haven't got a line of fire junior.

11520:
I've felt better.

12000:
If I don't get my adrenalin going soon junior I'm gonna fall into a slumber.

12480:
I'm getting kinda old for this.

12960:
Good riddance punk.

13440:
Good riddance punk.

13920:
I've always wanted to do this junior. I'm gonna make that cocky whippersnapper Garry Roachburn suffer!

15360:
Did Biff teach you everything you know junior?

15840:
When we get a chance junior I'll need some dressing.

16800:
There. Now I'm ready.

17280:
I don't want to do this junior.

17760:
This isn't gonna cost me anything is it missy?

18240:
I was doing this kind of thing before you were born junior.

18720:
You haven't shaken my skepticism yet junior.

19200:
The way your luck's running junior it's no longer good for my reputation to be on your team.

19680:
I can't tell you how much I miss the old days junior. There was only fifteen of us working for A.I.M. and we always had work.

20160:
It's hard to believe you're still alive.

20640:
I believe O'Brian ows you a kiss junior.

21120:
You civilians... fiddling with things for no reason. I don't need this. You've got to give the team a chance junior.

21600:
Basically I take care of myself. I eat right, avoid seaport women.

22080:
I've got a full squad's worth of experience under my hood junior.

22560:
Ok junior, I'll look the other way this time.

23040:
Have you been drinking junior?

23520:
It looks like that mouthy twerp Roachburn.

24480:
You can't do that to Pops junior and expect to get away with it.

25920:
Another job came in junior. I think of taking the one that offers the best signing bous.

26400:
Let the old guy give you some advice here junior. Hide! Hide real well!

26880:
We ain't got a chance now junior.

27360:
Rookie mistake.

27840:
Smart negotiating there junior.

28320:
Greenhorn alert! Greenhorn alert!

28800:
Can't let nothing stand in our way junior.

29280:
I'll take care of her.

30240:
Look junior.

30720:
Junior, you've got too many new guys joining up, and too many old guys getting their walking papers. In my age I don't need the crap.

31200:
We finished off that gang of punks junior.

31680:
I don't understand what went wrong.

32160:
I was willing to listen junior but you blew it.

32640:
I've met them all.

33120:
We've got the job done junior!

33600:
We definitely came out on top.

35040:
I've heard plenty.

35520:
This thing's as old as I am. I can't get it to work.

36000:
It's triggered junior. Triggered to take an arm.

36480:
I wouldn't be surprised if those punks planted something around here.

36960:
My age is catching up with me junior. I can't stay afloat!

37440:
That's it junior.

38400:
Not today. I've got to live a long time junior and I attribute it to my cautiousness.

38880:
No son. I've met them all, but I ain't never heard of any quite as deadly as yourself.

39360:
No junior. You might recall I was there. I left in protest.

39840:
It's a heck of a coincidence junior but everyone is offering the same amount.

40320:
Feels good doesn't it junior? ... Where was I going again?

40800:
It's highly disrespectful junior. I'll be removing you from the list of potentials.

41280:
I can't work for you as long as that cocky whippersnapper Garry Roachburn is on your team.

42720:
We should keep the time in mind junior.

43200:
I'm not feeling quite as uptight as I was junior. I guess I could stay for a little while longer.

43680:
You've got a new merc junior.

44160:
It's always a pleasure to work with pops junior. Simply because he's there I'll make the trip.

45600:
No junior. With your luck it's hard to believe you're still alive.

46080:
Just like I already told you...

46560:
Looks like you have cash flow problems junior.

47040:
It was a pleasant experience junior. We'll be seing you.

47520:
I've seen them all and I ain't never seen any quite as deadly as yourself junior. I'm getting my tail out of here while it's still intact.

48000:
If that cocky little snitch Garry Roachburn had been on your team before I joined son I never would've. Now unload him or I'm leaving.

49440:
I'm looking forward to working for you junior. It's always a pleasure to work with pops.

50880:
Just like I already told you...

51360:
Looks like you have cash flow problems junior.

51840:
I'm looking forward to working for you junior.

52320:
I've got a full squad's worth of experience under my hood junior.

52800:
Come on junior...

53280:
I think we can work something out junior. Just give me some time.

53760:
Sorry junior, but I'm gonna have to go with the highest.

54240:
I'm gonna make that cocky whippersnapper Garry Roachburn suffer!

55200:
There won't be none of that wailing and dealing crap this time around junior.

55680:
Look junior, the cash is gonna help finance my retirement.
