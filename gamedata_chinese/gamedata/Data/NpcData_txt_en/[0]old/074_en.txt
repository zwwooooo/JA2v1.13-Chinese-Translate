Mm hm. So you're the ones blowing everything all to hell. Well, no one's blowing me, all to hell. I'm Alex Perkolopolis. Call me Perko.

480:
What.

960:
I like small things, but small talk isn't one of them.

1440:
Mm hm. I repair almost anything... except electronics. Shocked myself on a hillbilly's cowprod, and I wasn't operational for weeks. Frigged me up.

1920:
What do you want me to do with this hunk a crap?

2400:
I'd give just about anything for a Tom Jones CD. Queen's frigged with all my mail, so nothing's coming in. All I've got is the Harlem Boys Choir, Greatest Hits.

2880:
Whoa. Slow down. You'll get me all excited.

3360:
Frig that, I want to have a sandwich and relax. Besides, I'll get blood all over my friggin' slippers.

3840:
This hurts worse than a good spanking...

4320:
I've got work to do.

4800:
I don't know what you heard, but I don't take money for that anymore. You want something fixed, I'll fix it, but nothing else.

5280:
Well, let's see what you need fixed. And don't be getting smart on me.

5760:
You know what I miss most? Summer sausage. You don't see it in the stores anymore. Friggin' war.

6240:
I haven't got all friggin' day.

7200:
This the crap you broke? Butterfingers...

7680:
Mm hm. Let me look.

8160:
I don't do electronics. Take it to Fredo in Grumm.

8640:
What the... this ain't broke. Stop wasting my time.

9120:
What a can of worms! I'll have to do it slow, and it's going to cost you more for me to do it that way.

9600:
This is a no brainer.

10080:
This isn't adding up!

10560:
Mm hm.

11040:
You gave me too much. I told you, I don't do that for change anymore.

11520:
Pending any unforeseen complications, I'll have it done as soon as I can.

12000:
Friggin' waste of my time!

12480:
Get this crap outta here.

12960:
What the... I can only do so much at a time, you know.

13440:
When I get ya, I'll fix ya!

13920:
Sorry. I hurt my wrist in a scouting accident, and it's taking me longer than I expected to get your stuff done. Come back later.

14400:
What the frig! Get rid of this crap first!

15360:
I'm going home. Talk to me tomorrow if you still need something fixed.

15840:
You know, while you were down there...

16320:
Well, it's like this. After I quit my old job, I needed to make some cash. So, I started sharpening knives. Next thing you know, it's, "Hey, Perko? Can you fix this?" Then, I'm fixing everybody's goddamn problems!

16800:
I don't give a crap as long as they pay me. But I draw the line at electronics. If you can plug it in, I'm not touchin' it. You'll have to take it elsewhere.

17280:
This whole friggin' country's completely out to lunch. I don't care who you are or what you're doing here, but if you want my two cents, shoot the bitch. She's been nothing but bad for business.
