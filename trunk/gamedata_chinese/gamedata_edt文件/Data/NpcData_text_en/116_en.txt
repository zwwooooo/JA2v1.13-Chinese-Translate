I got dibs, that's all I'm saying.

480:
You come 'round again, huh?

960:
It's just like fishing. Ya never know what yer gonna find in the junkyard. Some days, you come up empty. Other times, I get me a prize.

1440:
One time, in the trunk of a Caddy, I found a bunch of old nuddie photos. Heh-heh. Sold 'em to some Mexican driving an ice cream truck.

1920:
Ah, no. Ain't gonna be able to find room for that.

2400:
Don't tell anyone this, but I'm figuring when this war lifts, well, I'll get me enough junk so's I can start my own yard.

2880:
Rat got your ass er something?

3360:
My prime has come and passed, I'm afraid.

3840:
Lord, my time is comin'...

4320:
Well, I ain't getting any younger...

4800:
Oh, that's so kind of ya.

5280:
You rat's ass!

5760:
Awful kind of ya.

6240:
Place is a shootin' gallery. No time to talk now.

6720:
Why... thank you. Here, I got something for you, too. Don't quite know exactly what it is, but maybe you can find some use for it.

7200:
Only kidding, of course. You aren't going to find anything around here that I haven't already seen. Spend my days sifting through this dump.

7680:
I have to keep laughing. Try to keep a smile on my face. No point in dwellin' over one's situation. I eat what I find, find what I eat. It wasn't always like that, but well, what can I do?

8160:
Army burned down my home four years ago. Everything I had was in it, including my family. They took my whole life from me in less than five minutes.

8640:
Got no purpose now. Just wandering around trying to survive and wondering why I bother.

9120:
Now, if that Deidranna were to get what's coming to her, then that would be worth staying alive for.

9600:
Good luck to ya. You're pretty darn close to finishing the job you come to do. And when you finally do meet her, I want you to put one right between the Queen's eyes, for me.

10080:
Why not? I used to panhandle before I got into junkin'.
