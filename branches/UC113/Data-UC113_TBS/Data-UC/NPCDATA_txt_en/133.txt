Officer Plodski at your disposal. What's your business?

480:
Do you have a crime to report, or are you here to surrender? You look familiar.

960:
I've been having a very hectic day helping Detective Bronski with his interrogations.

1440:
You wouldn't believe the number of arrests we've made recently. Crime is on the increase.

1920:
I need more payoffs and hot blondes, not that.

2400:
I'm a busy man, so what's this all about? You got a complaint to make or something?

2880:
How would you like to try our accomodation facilities? Like for about the next 20 years...

3360:
Ah, no thanks, I like this job too much.

3840:
I'm bleeding! I've been hit! Officer down! Code red! Get a doctor, quick!

4320:
Gotta get back to business with that nosy reporter Miranda. Wonder if hanging her upside down from the bars will do the trick...

4800:
Holy shit, boys, hit the floor! Some scumbags are using the police station for target practice!

5280:
If I get Miranda talking, Bronski says I might make detective! Wow!

5760:
I'm gonna rip your arms off any time now!
