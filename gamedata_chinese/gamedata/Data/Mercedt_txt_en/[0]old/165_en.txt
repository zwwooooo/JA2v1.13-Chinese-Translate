0:
It is an ingrate.

480:
Finally, the pleasure commences.

960:
I am overwhelmed by their aggression.

1440:
Finally, the pleasure commences.

1920:
I believe we have found the source of our troubles. It is time to turn off the tap.

2400:
I, Gaston Cavalier, shall stay on alert for those that have vanished.

2880:
I am alerted by the strange sounds around me.

3360:
I must be respectful of the danger that is near.

3840:
I must be respectful of the danger that is near.

4320:
I do not like this. I am suspicious... like a jealous lover engaged to a harlot.

4800:
I am overwhelmed by their aggression.

5280:
I have located something.

5760:
It is there for the taking.

6240:
I am not at ease with an empty weapon.

6720:
I shall die... soon... with bravery and honor.

7200:
In death, the Fox has left many a broken heart scattered across this pitiful place.

7680:
I am saddened by the loss of Buns. But, perhaps, death will offer her a second chance at life. May she not suffer from cemented emotion the next time around.

8160:
Buzz is at peace now. Only death, or Gaston, could quell such internal anger.

8640:
I am without a destiny.

9120:
Mon dieu... a gun that does not work.

9600:
Fire at will, but you cannot damage MY confidence.

10080:
I was mislead. A victim of dirty tactics.

10560:
Ha... you will die, you incompetent fool!

11040:
It would require the wind of a hurricane to come even close.

11520:
I can only hope my injury does not leave a repulsive scar.

12000:
Fatigue is the most dangerous of enemies.

12480:
I am... without air.

12960:
You are dismissed... easily.

13440:
It was inevitable.

13920:
This Malice... He butchers the language of my mother. I can no longer bear this verbal slaughter.

14400:
Flo disgraces the battlefield with her presence. She is not French, this woman. She has lived in America. And she has bought many hamburgers from that clown... Ronald whatever.

14880:
I do not wish to be Biff. He is an imbecile of the highest caliber, much like his partner in business.

15360:
I am leaving this place. Biff is intolerable and incompetent. I would not even allow this boy to park my automobile.

15840:
It is tragic. I had hoped the pieces would be bigger.

16320:
I would much prefer the use of a boat.

16800:
I am dispensed with my chore.

17280:
It would be ludicrous.

17760:
Gaston has passed through the deathtrap. We shall taste the champagne of victory.

18240:
I believe we have concluded our duty as animal control officers.

18720:
A clown without a circus.

19200:
I am bored. Bored with my own despair.

19680:
Ah... My heart aches for the company of civilized men.

20160:
The plane has spotted us. I am their target.

20640:
I am guessing my equipment did not come in a box.

21120:
I am forced to endure scoundrels. War, it is a magnet for the lowest of class.

21600:
America! A country without culture. A people drawn to bright flashy lights like bugs.

22080:
I have earned this.

22560:
Am I the only one alerted by the pure stupidity of this?

23040:
Why do I imagine you puzzled?

23520:
I throw in my glove. I can turn my back on my people no longer. When Malice speaks, my ancestors twirl in their tombs. This is not French! Not French, I tell you. I am leaving now.

24000:
I am shamed by Flo. I will leave quietly without incident.

24480:
Oh, Fox... Oh Fox.

24960:
You are hot, Buns! An open fire on a cold winter night.

25440:
Buzz, there is such untapped passion in you.

26880:
I am blinded! I shall feel my way through the darkness. I have done this before.

27360:
It is not possible.

27840:
She was most impressed with Gaston. This was obvious.

28320:
We share the same space with our enemies.

28800:
I, Gaston Cavalier, shall stay on alert for those that have vanished.

29760:
I treat my gun like a woman, and the trigger responds to my touch.

30240:
I am wary. He appears to be a friendly fellow, but so did our pilot.

30720:
You are not the first to part with Gaston due to inferior sentiments.

31200:
They have been dispensed. I savor victory yet again.

31680:
I do not like this. I am suspicious... like a jealous lover engaged to a harlot.

32160:
I can only hope we will be meeting other women.

32640:
Now, there is the cat's meow.

33120:
I have done what it is I came to do. Now, I must attend to urgent needs of a kinder nature. It was a pleasure, filled with many moments.

33600:
They flee to safety. Ha! They respect my talent.

35040:
Include me in this.

35520:
It is an affront to my dignity to be holding such junk.

36000:
It would probably be best if someone else were to play with this.

36480:
I do not like this. I am suspicious... like a jealous lover engaged to a harlot.

37440:
I am at my destiny. How will you use me now?

37920:
At last, I am no longer without connection to the civilized world. The computer is back in order.

38400:
My god... I am alive.

38880:
Something tells me you have done this before.

39360:
We sit like ducks in this place. Someone must be alerted of our bad landing.

39840:
There is no way to exit up here. There must be a way to open the door below.

40320:
My departure is not possible. We are lead down the same path in this tunnel of war.

40800:
I was not advised of the proper attire, and resent the shivers that dance over my body.

41280:
I believe we have found the source of our troubles. It is time to turn off the tap.

41760:
What a despicable place! I doubt they sell wine with a cork in this town.

42240:
The chill has finally left my body. I have skied in warmer climates.

42720:
Gaston has passed through the deathtrap. We shall taste the champagne of victory.

43200:
I believe they await our arrival. I am sure there are people in Algiers who were shaken by the noise!

43680:
Everyone has passed through the trap of death. I am unsure if this is for the best.

44160:
I can only hope we will be meeting other women.

44640:
Raul is a man in need of slapping. However, in times of war we are forced into the mercy of men like this.

45120:
I will kill this man, personally.

45600:
I am wary. He appears to be a friendly fellow, but so did our pilot.

46080:
Welcome Manuel... Would you, ah,  take offence if I was to offer you my eau de toilette? You may use it liberally as if it was your own.

46560:
Welcome Colonel. There is always room on my team for men with proper military training.

47040:
I wonder, Mister Kulba, how many decades have flew by since you were doing this, ah,  spare time, weekend warrior, stint as a hobby?

47520:
A Japanese cowboy? And a movie star? Where do these mercenaries come from? And what possibly lies ahead, eh? Barney, the dinosaur?

48000:
I am taken aback! It is not possible. A weapon I never killed anyone with before?

48480:
I am unsure of this... A blender of death under the control of strangers.

48960:
It was inevitable.

49440:
Perhaps, it is best I have a look at that paper.

49920:
It was beautiful. An inspiration to witness. An explosion like no other.

50400:
It appears that not all the guards were in their quarters. Or, perhaps, we are making contact with different troops.

50880:
An eighteenth century hand mortar. An ingenious weapon for its time. French, I believe.

51360:
I believe we have concluded our duty as animal control officers.

51840:
This is ironic! The imbecile has blown himself to pieces.

52320:
Unfortunately, everything on his person is also in many pieces.

52800:
Without wirecutters, I am left with little choice but to beat this barrier until it succumbs to my superior strength. I shall attempt to do so quietly, but it does not appear possible.

53280:
It is a most impressive door. It will not be opened easily.

53760:
It is time to go down... to the basement. I believe we have found the secret.

54240:
My God... What is that irritating noise?

54720:
That is the signal. We have access to the fan.

55200:
It is as I suspected - the coordinates for launching the missiles. Like the imbeciles they are, they have marked the origin.. .

55680:
I shall turn their stupidity against them. I should be able to arrange this easily at the controls, then I shall make my escape quickly by way of the elevator.
