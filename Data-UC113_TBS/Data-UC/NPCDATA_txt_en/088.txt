Hello, I am Maria Cruz De la Jolla Cardinal, from UBN.

480:
I am glad to see you here!

4320:
Look me up if you're ever in New York. I'd love to see you and your big gun again!

5760:
So many things went wrong with this assignment. Where do I begin?

6240:
First, I get kidnapped practically on camera! Well mostly on camera, until my photographer, Bruce, ran off.

6720:
I suppose he's hiding somewhere safe while you rescue me. Just wait until I get my hands on him!

7200:
Of course I'll go with you. What, did you expect me to do, STAY HERE?

7680:
Bruce, you good-for-nothing pantywaist *******. I should bitch-slap you for not warning me when those thugs run up on us!

8160:
I don't know how I can ever thank you and your people for saving me.

8640:
My editor, Mr. Hearst, will probably pay you dearly for the information that Bruce and I got away with.
