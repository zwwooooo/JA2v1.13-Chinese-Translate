0:
坏家伙。

480:
让敌人祈祷吧！

960:
它们把我逼到绝境了！

1440:
这有个紫色食人怪！

1920:
天啊！它真丑啊。

2400:
我认为我们错过了和紫色食人怪干一架。

2880:
唷，我听到一些声音。

3360:
天啊，真臭。那些紫色食人怪一定吃了太多的素食者。

3840:
这里有古怪，我不喜欢它。

4320:
真希望我带着Saint Ian奖章……它能保佑我干掉紫色食人怪。

4800:
这些混球现在一点也不好玩了！

5280:
Hmm，这是啥米？

5760:
有东西躺在那里。

6240:
装弹！

6720:
我中枪了……感觉像胸外伤、脑震荡还有结扎赶到一块了。

8640:
不好意思，我走神了。再说一遍？

9120:
枪卡壳了。

9600:
他们想把我打成肉酱！

10080:
呃……这和旅游手册上写的一点也不一样。

10560:
不知道我还剩了几条命。

11040:
我不认为我能击中。

11520:
天啊，抱歉，这里到处都是我的血。

12000:
如果不让我睡觉，我就不干了。

12480:
等一下。

12960:
晚安！

13440:
二号走廊打扫完毕！

15840:
什么叫“丢脸”，这就叫“丢脸”。

16800:
我这里搞定了。

17280:
恕难从命。

17760:
Hey-hey，好了好了！没什么比善始善终更好的了。

18240:
好啦，告诉我我赢了什么！跑车？礼品卷？还是让我做个超大的煎蛋卷。

18720:
我从没见过比这个更傻蛋的。

19200:
这个任务真是越来越让我烦躁了。

19680:
这些家伙的智商可能永远也达不了标，但是打架倒是够用了。

20160:
我们得到了天上的不受欢迎的关注！

20640:
这装备没一点用处。还不如扔雪球管用呢。

22080:
我可不是你的普通佣兵。

22560:
听起来像是出自一个纸上谈兵的家伙，而不是一个经验丰富的战地指挥官。

23040:
谁要是刚才没猜到这个结果，举手。

26400:
乡下太他妈的安静了，我可不太喜欢。我说我们得快点找到那个叫Miguel的家伙，然后安顿下来。

26880:
我的眼睛在流泪！只能看到一些影子。

27360:
这是徒劳的。

27840:
我喜欢这类人。

28320:
在这一区域发现敌人踪迹。

28800:
保持清醒，我们还没有完事。

29760:
枪口冒着青烟，敌人轰然倒地……伙计，没什么比这更爽的了。

30240:
那不就是我们正在找的那个小孩吗？

30720:
好吧，她最好开始祈祷吧，Miguel，因为她有大麻烦了。像是被爆头什么的。跟你一道真是快乐。

31200:
耶！我们很棒!在发出了敌人的死亡通知书后, 我们就可以杀到下一个地区去了。

31680:
不管谁偷我们盒子里的东西，我会拿这个盒子给他当棺材，你明白我的意思么。

32160:
你这个臭娘们给我站起来，我再毙你一次！她自找的……我最恨别人耍我！

32640:
小猫！我真的看到一只小猫！

33120:
你是我们反抗军里最好的指挥官。我早知道了。我从一开始一直到女王的覆灭都在这里注意着你们。你们做的好！

33600:
他们肯定觉得赢不了了，所以撇下我们跑了。

34080:
让我睡一会儿，就一会儿。

34560:
按时到达。

35040:
我同意。

35520:
这个便宜货完蛋了。扔了吧。

36000:
不要动！这里有陷阱。

36480:
把你的脚放好，伙计。乱逛可是很危险地。

36960:
一定要……找到能浮的东西………不然……我就死了……

37440:
到达指定地点，下一步干什么？


37920:
It's about time we get the computer back on-line. I felt a little stranded there for a bit.

38400:
Ugh! My aching back... That was a heck of a drop.

38880:
I betcha if Skyrider was our pilot, we wouldn't be in this situation.

39360:
If anybody saw the crash, they'll be looking to check it out. Better not hang around too long.

39840:
There doesn't seem to be a way out. Looks like we gotta find a way to open that door in the basement.

40320:
What do ya figure, I'm gonna tunnel a new tunnel out? There's no turning back now.

40800:
Oooch! It's colder than a witch's mammary gland!

41280:
So that's where the border guards are coming from. What do you say we smoke 'em out?

41760:
This place ain't floating in dough that's for sure.

42240:
Whuh! Things are warming up. Wasn't sure if we'd run into polar bears there for a second.

42720:
Numbers don't add up. Looks like we left part of the team behind.

43200:
We got a way to get there, but I also got a ringing in my ears. Like I'm sure everyone within miles of here does.

43680:
Hard to believe, but the team is intact.

44160:
Is it just me or does anyone else want to spend the day in there hanging out and reading every magazine on the shelf?

44640:
I'm gonna have to do everything in my power to keep myself from seriously hurting that guy.

45120:
This is gonna be a pleasure.

45600:
That fellow is a long way from home. I got a good feeling about him...as long as I'm first through the fan, that is.

46080:
Good to have an Omerta rebel along for the ride, Manuel.

46560:
You've seen a few things, Colonel, that's obvious, but I wasn't counting on recruiting anyone from the other side.

47040:
Stay close, Mister Kulba. That reserve training was probably eons ago.

47520:
You could turn out to be a real treat, Tex.

48000:
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.

48480:
This fan thing smells like a stunt for Houdini.

48960:
It looks like your journey has came to an end.

49440:
Gimme that piece of paper for a second.

49920:
Nice blast! Always enjoy the really big ones. Don't imagine they'll be sending any missiles anywhere from there.

50400:
Looks like we got more than just the border patrol to contend with.

50880:
It might be some kind of medieval weapon. Not really sure.

51360:
Those puddy-cats got serious attitude. Actually, I should say HAD serious attitude.

51840:
Oh! That hurt, Raul. Stop it already, you're killing me.

52320:
Ah shoot! The dumbass blew all his stock up, too...

52800:
I could probably push this thing off. Though cutting through it would have made a hell of a lot less noise.

53280:
Whoever built this door obviously built it to keep people out.

53760:
Let's hope that was the door downstairs I heard opening.

54240:
Geez Louise! That's loud!

54720:
We're on deck! They shutdown the fan.

55200:
Yup! They were planning on raining missiles down over Arulco all right. Paper's got all the math to do exactly that. Gives the coordinates for this facility, too...

55680:
Here's an idea... I'll pop the coordinates of this place into the control panel, and create my own little rainstorm. Just have to haul ass into the elevator when I'm done.
