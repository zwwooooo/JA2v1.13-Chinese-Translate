0:
Adversaries.

480:
At last. With any luck there'll be a couple of males to shoot.

960:
I got my hands full.

1440:
Another one.

1920:
There's something about it that reminds me of Lynx.

2400:
Wonder what kind of pet these things would make.

2880:
Thought I heard something... could be wrong.

3360:
Ouf, those things even smell like Lynx, especially in the morning.

3840:
I'm ready... for whatever.

4320:
Maybe I'll get to kill a cock-a-roach.

4800:
I just love the attention.

5280:
Something right there.

5760:
Here.

6240:
Need lead.

6720:
Let me die! It'll end the misery.

8640:
Why do I bother?

9120:
Firearm's jammed!

9600:
Give me the chance, and you're dead meat.

10080:
That was refreshing.

10560:
You call that close?

11040:
You can't be serious...

11520:
I caught one.

12000:
Want some down time.

12480:
Panting like a rabid dog.

12960:
Much deserved.

13440:
Piss off!

13920:
I can't believe I wasted my life on that man. Just looking at Lynx makes me vomit.

14880:
Lynx deserves to die... slowly... with me watching the whole thing, from the beginning to its glorious conclusion.

15360:
I'd rather have blown away Lynx, but Mike makes a fine second choice.

15840:
Doubt there's an ear to collect.

16320:
I'm fine. Just don't piss me off!

16800:
I could use something to do.

17280:
No.

17760:
I did my job. But there were things about her I admired.

18240:
I have absolutely nothing against females, especially mothers, other than the fact that they give birth to males.

18720:
What do you expect from one of them.

19200:
I'm getting depressed. I should just go on a rampage and shoot up the place.

19680:
This whole group makes me cringe. Killing a couple might put a smile on my face.

20160:
Check the skies!

20640:
Crap! Crap! Crap! If I got anything decent in terms of equipment, I'd know it would be a mistake.

21120:
Pick one, anyone. I feel like killing somebody.

21600:
Let me make it clear, I hate everybody. And I do mean everybody!

22080:
Pinch me!

22560:
Brain surgeon, for sure.

23040:
What a freakin' shock that was.

23520:
You brought that son-of-a-bitch, Lynx, down here. Well, let me make my feelings known. He's a two-timer who's only alive because I haven't yet figured out the most gratifying way to kill him.

25920:
Ya. Like I'm in a rush!

26400:
Mike... He'll do!

26880:
I can't see squat!

27360:
Boring, boring, boring.

27840:
He can consider himself lucky... I'll let him live.

28320:
All right! I'm anticipating fun. We've got playmates in this section.

28800:
Pisses me off! I haven't got all day to look for 'em. Bunch of wieners.

29760:
I don't carry it around just to look good, jackass!

30240:
I'm sure that's Joey Graham. I say we castrate him. Put an end to his wandering ways.

30720:
Look pal, don't worry about the welcoming committee. Let's just get to work. I'm a professional here. Show me some targets.

31200:
That's the end of them.

31680:
You know, why is it that when I get something from a man, there's always less in the box than I expected?

32160:
I bet Lynx did her. It would explain why she turned out to be bitter, cruel and heartless. Did her a favor. Put her out of her misery. Not much else you can do.

32640:
Here pussycat. I got some catnip for ya.

33120:
Yeah! You know, we did all right. Nothing like a woman and a gun, I tell you. Hell hath no fury! You remember that.

33600:
They pulled out early. Typical men.

34080:
I'm feeling very irritable and unproductive. I'm going to get some sleep.

34560:
I'm up and back at the grindstone.

35040:
Same here.

35520:
Where'd this stuff come from? A garage sale? It's not working.

36000:
Hmm... it's rigged.

36480:
That looks more suspicious than a happy man.

36960:
Just let me drown... Timing couldn't be better.

37440:
Yeah! I made it. So, what now?

38400:
Ya, right. Like you have the slightest clue about what you're doing! Take a hike!

39360:
Take a long walk down a short pier. I'm doing my nails.

39840:
Ya, like I've been waiting around for you. I got plans!

40320:
Buzz Garneau is not here now. Say what you must. Be advised that any male callers will die long before they ever hear from me.

40800:
Whatever.

41280:
I ain't going to be a part of it, and you don't really want me to be. Otherwise, Lynx is a deadman.

42240:
Think again. I could vomit just imagining spending more time with Lynx. As a matter of fact, I think I will... vomit, that is.

42720:
So what's the deal? You want me to stick around, or what?

43200:
Okay, so I'm staying.

43680:
Yeah... I guess.

45600:
It's been loads and loads of fun, but now it's time to go home and program my VCR.

46080:
Listen closely. I told you...

46560:
Can't see how. You'll probably have to sell your body to get the cash to pay me, and I haven't got that kind of time.

47040:
Like I'll even remember you.

48000:
I ain't going to be a part of it, and you don't really want me to be. Otherwise, Lynx is a deadman.

48960:
Think again. I could vomit just imagining spending more time with Lynx. As a matter of fact, I think I will... vomit, that is.

50880:
Listen closely. I told you...

51360:
Can't see how. You'll probably have to sell your body to get the cash to pay me, and I haven't got that kind of time.

51840:
I'm listening...

52320:
Did you catch my marksmanship? I'm skilled in all types of weapons.

52800:
I'm waiting.

53280:
What are you willing to commit to?

53760:
I haven't got time for this bullshit!

54240:
I'll go... Just keep me away from that whore-son, Lynx, and men in general.

55200:
Just so you know, this contract is nearly over. Consider yourself informed.

55680:
What can I say? I'm justified asking for more.
