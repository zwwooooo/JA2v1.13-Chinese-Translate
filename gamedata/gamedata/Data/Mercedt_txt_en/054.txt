More aggressors.

480:
They're here. Let's get the show on the road.

960:
I'd like to get outta here while I can still walk!

1440:
Killer chiggers on the loose!

1920:
My God! It's like a...it's like the Six Million Dollar Chigger!

2400:
I think one of those steriod-induced chiggers came through.

2880:
Hear that?

3360:
Ugh-ah, I hope someone just cut the cheese. Otherwise, we're downwind of a rampaging giant chigger.

3840:
Something's setting off my internal alarms.

4320:
Lions and tigers and chiggers...oh, my.

4800:
Get outta my face, chiggers! Shoulda packed some DEET!

5280:
Looky yonder.

5760:
What's lying there?

6240:
This gun's empty.

6720:
I can't feel anything...I'm as close to dead as you get.

8640:
Wait a minute, I lost my bearings. What am I supposed to be doing?

9120:
My goddamned gun is jammed, pardon my French.

9600:
If I don't get outta here, my goose is cooked!

10080:
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

10560:
Well... Better to watch it than feel it.

11040:
Poor chance from here. Maybe from another position.

11520:
If I keep losing blood, sooner or later, I'll black out.

12000:
I'm pooped. I have to sack out for a while.

12480:
I'm out of breath. Give me a sec.

12960:
You're dead, pea brain.

13440:
Rubbed out that chigger!

15840:
There goes my appetite for the next week.

16800:
Ready for something new.

17280:
No. I draw the line.

17760:
I would rather have seen her suffer for a long time...but hey, this'll do.

18240:
Yeah, baby! You make a pretty corpse!

18720:
I know what that idiot's problem is: not enough secondhand smoke!

19200:
Next time, I'll pick a more exciting assignment...like shooting subway rats in Brooklyn.

19680:
Jesus, I hope there's no group photos. I wouldn't want to be seen with this bunch of second grade dropouts.

20160:
Holy moly! They're making a strafing run!

20640:
There isn't enough scotch tape in the world to hold this cruddy equipment together.

22080:
I'm self-taught!

22560:
Pretty cheesy plan.

23040:
And the Golden Turkey award goes to...

26400:
It's a good feeling to have my feet on terra firma. Now, to find that rebel leader Miguel.

26880:
Holy moly! I'm unable to open my eyes.

27360:
Nothing is going to come of this.

27840:
A neighborly kind of fellow.

28320:
Tread carefully. There's aggressors around.

28800:
We didn't get them all, so let's be careful.

29280:
Wow! You don't find one of these every day.

30240:
Kid over there looks like he might be hiding from someone.

30720:
Maybe on a real good day, Miguel, but we just ruined the chances of that. You let us get to work, and things will be fine.

31200:
Yeah! That's a clean sweep! There's no dirt left.

31680:
Hold on. Looks like we have a problem here. Where's the stuff?

32160:
How's that feel, honey? Just so you know, it feels damn good to me, and everybody else around here.

32640:
Dog food!

33120:
Nothing like standing by each other through thick and thin, eh? Thanks for everything, and you know what I mean. I was here from day one.

33600:
Uh, they pulled out. I hate that.

34080:
Gonna grab some sleep. I'll give you a holler when I'm up.

34560:
Okay, I'm back to work.

35040:
Yeah, I'll echo that.

35520:
Need to get this fixed.

36000:
Oh baby! We got a live one here.

36480:
I wouldn't be going anywhere near that.

36960:
One... more minute... That's as long as I can tread...

37440:
I'm here. Need instruction.
