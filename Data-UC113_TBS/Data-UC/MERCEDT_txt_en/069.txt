I'm in combat! 

1440:
Came across one!

1920:
It took forever to find! And it was right under our noses! 

2400:
If it has to get done, I'm the right man to do it! 

2880:
Listen, Commander. 

3360:
It smells like crap!

3840:
I'm getting a bad feeling about this place. 

4320:
Let's not be overconfident. 

4800:
I'd better get out of here! 

5280:
I spotted something! 

5760:
Take a look at this. 

6240:
Ammo's a problem! 

6720:
Fighting to stay conscious... Don't know how long I can last!

I can't get a handle on a good direction. 

9120:
My piece is jammed! 

9600:
Sniper! 

10080:
It's more painful than it looks! 

10560:
That was a little too close for my liking... 

11040:
I don't have a clear shot. 

11520:
Took a flesh wound. 

12000:
We'll have to keep our eyes on the clock! 

12480:
I need to ease up for a moment. 

12960:
Problem solved. 

13440:
Problem solved. 

13920:
Unusually Ruthless Reuban... Crazy Reuban... Trimmer of the family tree. You can call him whatever you want, but get rid him!

15840:
You'd better put out the call for blood donors. 

16320:
I should have been able to handle it. 

16800:
Colonel Kelly reporting for duty, Commander. 

17280:
It ain't going to happen! 

17760:
She had a lot of class! 

18240:
This one's ours to win.

18720:
I got the drop on this guy. 

19200:
I wish I could build an extension on my house! 

19680:
I don't want any part of your sordid affairs! 

20160:
Empty Record # 42

20640:
This crap is malfunctioning. 

21120:
That cloud over your head's gotten way too dark for me! 

21600:
Empty Record # 45

22080:
I'm a professional!

22560:
I think you're making a mistake... 

23040:
Listening to you has been a mistake!

23520:
What are you doing bringing crazy Reuban down here?

25920:
You're shy a couple of greenbacks! 

26400:
I'm gone! This place is a crap shoot and you're shooting crap!

26880:
I don't have a clear shot. 

27360:
I doubt anyone can do it!

27840:
We won this one! 

28320:
We could be in for some resistance along the way! 

28800:
Let's not be overconfident. 

29280:
Who could refuse such a gift? 

29760:
Excellent choice... 

30240:
That guy won't pose any more problems! 

30720:
You can't be foolish enough to think you can win this without me? 

31200:
That troop won't pose any more problems! 

31680:
We mucked it! Let's hope there's a next time. 

32160:
She never had a chance! 

32640:
I've got a situation here! 

33120:
Let's call it a day!

33600:
We're running things now! 

34080:
Just give me a couple of minutes, and I'll get back to you. 

34560:
Consider me on duty! 

35040:
I'll sign on! 

35520:
This thing is malfunctioning. 

36000:
I think we should get an explosive's guy down here to take a look at this. 

36480:
Stay alert! The ground seems displaced around here. 

36960:
I'm gasping for air... Too tired to swim... 

37440:
Now... It's our turn!
