Cheerio. I don't recall we've met. Well, welcome to ma bar then. It's good to have you here.

480:
Good to see you again, old chap.

960:
Got a few regulars, here, I do. Mostly blokes getting out of the sun. Bloody hot here, I find.

1440:
Can't complain about business, but lately, you know, it's uh, it's mostly people coming in to use the loo.

1920:
Very kind of you, chap, but eh, I've no use for that.

2400:
It's a right good life, if you ask me. Never thought me a bartender, but I fancy it now. Pace is slow, blokes are kind, and every so often a, uh, pretty lady comes in, eh. Right proper, it is.

2880:
Maybe I'm wrong, chap, but you'll pardon me if I am, but I reckon, uh, you could use a stiff pint. Feeling a little tense, I gather.

3360:
No thanks. I wouldn't know what to do with a gun.

3840:
Need a doctor...

4320:
I'll leave you be, chap.

4800:
I do accept tips, but I'd rather you order first.

5280:
Got some choice bottles, eh. What's your fancy?

5760:
No hurry, chap. Take your time.

6240:
Blimey this heat, eh! Cold drink will do you good.

6720:
Sorry, chap. It's cash only. With all the wankers 'round here, I'd have me a bar full of knicknacks by now.

7200:
Not in the buying business, friend. Sorry.

7680:
Hmm, might be worth something... but not to me.

8640:
Nothing personal you understand, but, eh, it's a cash-only bar.

10560:
You're covered, chap.

11040:
Cheers, and thank you.

11520:
Wet your whistle, chap. But let me know when you'd like another.

12000:
When you're thirsty, just call.

12480:
You might be wanting this.

13440:
Bloody buller bastard!

13920:
Thanks, chap... Much appreciated.

14400:
Bloody big commotion... I will not be tending bar 'til it quiets down.

14880:
Sorry, chap, but the locals would stop comin' in if they knew I was serving you.
