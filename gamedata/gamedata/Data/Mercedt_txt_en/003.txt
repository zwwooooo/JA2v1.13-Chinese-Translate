0:
Fightin' time.

480:
All right, we're on.

960:
Mayday! Mayday!

1440:
Another one of my relatives.

1920:
Jesus. Who the hell invited my mother-in-law?

2400:
Wonder if anybody can go one-on-one with those things and live.

2880:
I hear something.

3360:
Peeyew... I can't blame that on the dog... gotta be one of those huge pissants.

3840:
I've got that feelin' I always get just before all hell breaks loose.

4320:
Come out, come out, you big pissants, wherever you are.

4800:
They've got me by the short curlies!

5280:
What's that?

5760:
Over here.

6240:
Gun needs loadin'.

6720:
I don't think I'll make it in this condition.

7200:
You was my kind of people, Bull. I'll, uh, I'll make sure Jana and the kids are taken care of, and...I was glad to know ya, Bull.

7680:
You were amazing, Shadow. How'd they even see you? Learned a lot from you, man. Shoulda told you.

8160:
Wolf, you were better than ever, a lean, mean fightin' machine. I hate to see a man cut down in his prime.

8640:
Whoa. Just had a little aneurysm. Okay, what was happening?

9120:
Misfire. This gun needs unjammin'.

9600:
Runnin' into trouble here.

10080:
Ya won't hear me complain about a few bruises 'n' cuts 'n' broken bones.

10560:
That was close. I don't plan on missing.

11040:
Can't get a solid handle on that from here.

11520:
Hit a blood vessel. I think I'll be okay.

12000:
I'm gonna drop if I don't get some sleep.

12480:
Crampin' up. Gotta breathe for a minute.

12960:
Another one bites the dust.

13440:
I love how they splatter.

13920:
Can't believe anybody would ever hire a shifty creep like Dr. Q., let alone make me work with him.

15360:
Mike might've been a good merc, but he was just flesh and blood, like everyone else.

15840:
Man, that's GOTTA hurt. Then again, maybe not!

16800:
All right, done.

17280:
Nope, not interested.

17760:
Ding, dong, the bitch is DEAD!

18240:
Yee-haw! Give birth to that you friggin' egg sac!

18720:
That A-hole's startin' to get under my skin.

19200:
This assignment's startin' to feel like it's never gonna end.

19680:
What a sorry bunch of lily-livered bootlickers.

20160:
Aerial attack! Eyes up!

20640:
The equipment I've been gettin' musta come right off the boat from Taiwan.

21600:
I don't like those oriental types. You never know what they're thinkin'.

22080:
Mom woulda been proud.

22560:
My granny could come up with a better scheme than that.

23040:
Stupid is as stupid does.

23520:
You shoulda asked me before bringin' in that crazy Dr. Q. Now I'm pissed. I would of never have signed a contract.

24480:
How 'bout that Bull, eh? I love this guy!

24960:
Way to be, Shadow. He knows what he's doin'.

25440:
I knew there was somethin' I liked about Wolf.

25920:
Catch me later. I'm still tryin' to decide if this is my kinda outfit.

26400:
Damn - Mike! I didn't count on havin' to go up against him.

26880:
Ahh monk breath! I'm blinded!

27360:
It can't be done. Well, at least I can't do it.

27840:
There's someone with their head screwed on right.

28320:
We got a confirmed enemy presence.

28800:
We haven't dealt with all of them, yet. Nobody get careless.

29760:
Ha! It's all in how ya pull the trigger.

30240:
I'm sure that's the twerp mommy's looking for. Joey something or other.

30720:
Good to be part of your little tropical situation, Miguel. You just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.

31200:
Well, well! That's the last of them.

31680:
Hm. Any chance this box came through Harlem's Lightfingers Shipping Company? It's not all here!

32160:
Sometimes, there just isn't any other way. Sad to say, but it's the truth. Didn't see an alternative.

32640:
Come to Grizzly...

33120:
Yeah! That's what I call combat! Mission-to-mission, side-by-side, there's no better group I've ever served with. Let me tell ya, I got enough memories to fill a lifetime. Everyone, keep in touch.

33600:
Hmm... Enemy's packed their bags and moved outta here.

34080:
I'll just take a couple of winks here. I'm no good to anyone.

34560:
I'm up. And I'm getting back on it.

35040:
Roger, me too.

35520:
Got another Taiwan special here.

36000:
Hold on. I got a feeling this is packin' a punch.

36480:
Hey, this area looks suspicious to me.

36960:
So... much water... so... little air... Can't catch my...breath.

37440:
I'm where I'm supposed to be.

38400:
Nah! From what I've heard, you and me wouldn't see eye-to-eye.

38880:
With your record, you'd be better off lookin' for kamikazes.

39360:
Sorry, I'm detailin' my '62 'stang this weekend and takin' her out for a drive up the coast. Been lookin' forward to this for weeks.

39840:
Well, y'see, this is the way it works - you want me, you gotta give me some advance warning.

40320:
Yeah, this is Steve Bornell. I can't stand these machines, so don't be surprised if I don't get your message for a while. Better to call me back when I'm here.

40800:
Maybe we'll do it again some time.

41280:
I don't work with Dr. Q., and take my advice, you shouldn't either. Word to the wise, beware of him.

42720:
Yeah, about this contract. It's about up. Are we renewing, or what's the deal?

43200:
It's always better the next time around, right? Right!

43680:
Excellent!

44160:
Hey, for a chance to be together with Bull, sign me up.

44640:
Hey, me and my Shadow. We're two of a kind, man. I'm in.

45120:
You got problems, but a chance to see the Wolf howl again...that appeals.

45600:
Yeah, like I'm gonna sign up for more of that. Guess again.

46080:
Open up your ears! I already told ya...

46560:
Well, ya gotta pay before I'll play. Know what I mean?

47040:
Whoa, that was quick. You think you know what you're doin'? More power to ya.

47520:
With your record, you'd be better off lookin' for kamikazes.

48000:
I don't work with Dr. Q., an' take my advice, you shouldn't either. Word to the wise, beware of him.

49440:
Hey, for a chance to be together with Bull, sign me up.

49920:
Hey, me and my Shadow. We're two of a kind, man. I'm in.

50400:
You got some problems, but a chance to see the Wolf howl again...that appeals.

50880:
Open up your ears! I already told ya...

51360:
Well, ya gotta pay before I'll play. Know what I mean?

51840:
Yeah, whaddaya want?

52320:
You bring the brain, I'll bring the brawn, y'know...

52800:
Talk to me! Like soon!

53280:
How long we talkin' about here?

53760:
Call me back when you're ready to deal, turkey.

55200:
Contract's almost up. Thought you should know.

55680:
Don't wanna shock ya, but prices are only guaranteed for the length of the contract.
