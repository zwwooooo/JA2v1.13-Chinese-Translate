Enemies.

480:
That's what I've been waiting on.

960:
Problems here.

1440:
Mega-maggot over there.

1920:
That's one well-fed maggot.

2400:
It's the work of those monster maggots.

2880:
Wonder what that noise was.

3360:
(sniff) Those maggots can sure pass some mean gas.

3840:
Big trouble's comin'. Yeah...

4320:
Place is probably swarming with maggots.

4800:
I got maggots crawlin' up my ass here!

5280:
Someone drop something?

5760:
Lookit.

6240:
Gotta reload.

6720:
I'm fading, need help.

8160:
Poor Nails.

8640:
Whoa... What was I doing?

9120:
Uh-oh, jammed gun here.

9600:
C'mon, you sons o' bitches! Is that the best you can do?

10080:
Looks worse than it is.

10560:
Startin' to get exciting.

11040:
Probably just waste ammo.

11520:
Gotta do something about this bleeder before I need a freakin' transfusion.

12000:
Gotta catch some z's.

12480:
Gotta stop. Chest pain.

12960:
Lie still.

13440:
Dead bag of pus.

14880:
Maybe we should just cut the dead weight. Ain't that right, BIFF??

15360:
I wasted Mike. Not bad, huh?

15840:
Looks better without a head anyway.

16800:
Done here.

17280:
You know what you can do with THAT order, don't-cha?

17760:
Too bad I hadda kill her. She was my kinda gal... feisty.

18240:
Maggots lost their mommy!

18720:
I'm sick of that goddamned dumbass.

19200:
Gonna think twice before I lay my ass on the line for this outfit.

19680:
Great team, if you don't mind pullin' their redhot butts out of the fire every ten minutes.

20160:
Bombers!

20640:
We'd be better off throwing this cheap crap away and fighting hand-to-hand, bare-ass naked.

21120:
I don't believe in an eye-for-an-eye. Someone takes out my eye, I take out both of his.

22080:
Hard work and clean living pays off.

22560:
Freakin' brilliant.

23040:
Totally unpredictable.

25440:
Nails done good.

25920:
Not ready yet.

26400:
That's Mike. Good Merc. Too bad.

26880:
I can't see a damn thing!

27360:
Forget this!

27840:
Seemed all right.

28320:
From what I'm picking up, the sector's got a few too many people.

28800:
Some of them got lucky. Probably still close-by, I bet.

29760:
Nailed the sucker!

30240:
Could that be the missing kid over there? I should teach him to respect his mother.

30720:
Well, she's gotta another thing coming.

31200:
We fried 'em all. Got room to move around.

31680:
Shipment looks shy of a full load.

32160:
Nothing like poppin' it to someone who begged for it. They'll probably give us the key to the town.

32640:
Trophy sighting!

33120:
Yeah, good job. You need a job done right, you know who to call.

33600:
Looks like they didn't want to stay and play.

34080:
Gotta saw some logs before I punch someone. I'll be up in a bit.

34560:
Sleep makes me nice. And, yeah, I'm working.

35040:
You're not alone, pal.

35520:
This piece of... has shit the bed.

36000:
Whoa. Gotta nasty surprise here.

36480:
Lookit. Don't look good.

36960:
I... can't... float... much longer!

37440:
I'm here. What next?

38400:
Nothing burns me up more than a C.O. who doesn't know how to treat his guys. Call me when you figure it all out.

38880:
I don't do battle for reckless C.O.'s.

39360:
Sorry, I'm doin' an interview with "Soldier of Fortune." Try me again later.

39840:
Can't make it happen. Give me some warning next time.

40320:
John Peters. Not here right now. Leave a message.

40800:
Okay, I'm history.

42240:
No! You got Biff Apscott on the team. Looks like a carrot, fights like a pussy.

42720:
My contract's closin' down. You interested in doing something about it?

43200:
You got it.

43680:
I'll be there.

45120:
You got Nails signed up. That's good. That balances out your downside. Okay, you got it.

45600:
What, sign up for more of the same? In your dreams.

46080:
Once more...

46560:
Ya, right! What are you going to pay me with?

47040:
Ya, okay. That's it, then.

47520:
I don't do battle for reckless C.O.'s.

48960:
No! You got Biff Apscott on the team. Looks like a carrot, fights like a pussy.

50400:
You got Nails signed up. That's good. That balances out your downside. Okay, you got it.

50880:
Once more...

51360:
Ya, right! What are you going to pay me with?

51840:
Yes?

52320:
I like to break people's necks. Maybe you could use a guy like that.

52800:
You there or what?

53280:
For how long?

53760:
Call me when you're ready to do business. I'll think about answering.

55200:
Yeah, getting near that time. Contract's closin' down.

55680:
Ya gotta pay more to get more. And I'm more now.
