0:
What do you want?

480:
Back again?

960:
Danubia isn't the nice country it appears to be.

1440:
Too many hostile places in this country.

1920:
I don't need that.

2400:
You've found a chopper pilot here.

2880:
Keep cool!

3360:
I'm too old for that fightin' stuff.

3840:
I need some medical treatment!

4320:
I'm sure you have more important things to do.

4800:
Too much shootin' around...

5280:
No money, no flight!

5760:
You can call me Goose. I've been in the chopper business for more years than it is good for me.

6240:
I'm looking for a ride home. Danubia isn't the right country for me. When we're done here, I'll book my flight home as soon as I can.

6720:
Bring me to Callisto Airport, and we might be able to find something to fly with.

7200:
This one looks great for our business!

7680:
Here's the deal: I charge by distance and risk. I'll get you where you want to go. All I need is fuel.

8160:
I don't fly to unfriendly zones. I'll drop you off or pick you up as close as possible.

8640:
I get paid after the job is done. Again, no money, no flying.

9120:
Just contact me me when you need me.

9600:
And now the problem: there are SAM sites spread all over Danubia. Flying near them means the risk of being down...

10080:
There's a SAM site east of Callisto. Take it out and life becomes much easier.

10560:
Well done. Now we have free space to fly.

11040:
Yes?

11520:
I found some informations for you. Managed to get the locations for the rest of the SAM sites.

12000:
There's one slightly south of Sheraton, another south of Galileo, and the last one is in Adrian. Hope that helps.

12480:
Another great job! Clearing Gothom gives us another source of fuel, and another airport to use.

12960:
Okay.

13440:
I'll never make it there and back on one tank of fuel.

13920:
The destination's got unfriendlies. I'll wait for new orders.

14400:
I don't fly to unfriendly zones.

14880:
I'm here.

15360:
Hurry up!

15840:
I can't wait any longer. I must fly back to base before I run out of fuel.

16320:
Enemy troops down there.

16800:
Unfriendly activity below.

17280:
I'm too old for active fighting.

17760:
Show me where to go.

18240:
Forget it! You tried to kill me.

18720:
Stay cool, or you have to fly by yourself.

19200:
I'm a pilot. I fly. That's all.

19680:
What's going on? I thought we were looking for a chopper...

20160:
I can't wait 'til we get there. Haven't flown in a long while.

20640:
Asshole!

21120:
Thanks for the medical treatment.

21600:
There's a hospital in Galileo. Take out the crap, and I could bring your wounded there.

22080:
Stay cool. Another day, another chance.

22560:
The way things are going, it won't be long before I can go home.

23040:
There's no chopper. I can do nothing for you.

23520:
Not the right conditions to fly today.

24000:
Get things under control, then we take another look.

24480:
Thought you forgot about me.

24960:
We were hit. I have to check the chopper when we're back at the base.

25440:
I have to go back. The chopper was hit!

25920:
Aargh, we're going down...
