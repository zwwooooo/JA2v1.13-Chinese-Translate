5600:
- Small third world country

6400:

The gross national product of the country is based on the export of precious metals, mainly gold and silver. ¡À

10400:
Light industry is located in the country, mostly in the towns of Grumm and Drassen. Foreign trade: Under international embargo controlled by the United Nations- the export of precious metals is strictly limited, only foodstuffs may be imported.

11200:
Arulco was once a tourist paradise and agricultural products accounted for 80% des export revenue. The current government has remodelled the economy to mining. The withdrawal from a self-sufficient agricultural society has drastically sunk the average income to one twentieth of what it was 15 years ago.

12000:
The international embargo has also contributed to the poverty of the population. Main source of income is narcotics. ¡À

12800:
¢æ Government ¢æ ¡À

18400:
Two infantry divisions: General Army and Queen's Guard (elite forces).

20000:
- Relatively small air force.

20800:
- Minimal heavy and light armament.

21600:
Military forces appear designed to put down internal conflict and civil unrest. However, they could pose a threat to surrounding third world nations and are currently undergoing rapid expansion. ¡À ¡À

22400:
¢æ Economy ¢æ ¡À

23200:
Country is rich in natural ores. ¡À

24000:
Mining operations have been ongoing for more than eleven years.

24800:
Believed to have 6 gold and silver mines, 5 of which are currently in operation. ¡À

25600:
Rate of ore extraction and exportation has been astronomical. ¡À

26400:
The imposed switch from a self-sufficient agricultural economy to one dominated by extracting and exporting natural resources has dramatically reduced the per capita income to a twentieth of what it was 15 years ago. ¡À

27200:
Much of the country's wealth has been spent on importing vanity goods for the Queen. The remainder of the national budget is allocated to propping up the military with foreign expertise and equipment. ¡À

28000:
The majority of the population is, in fact, destitute. ¡À ¡À

28800:
¢æ History ¢æ ¡À

29600:
Arulco's previous government has been considered a unique Democratic Monarchy. Although the country was run as a kingdom, ruled by a King and Queen, free elections were held every ten years to assert their legitimacy. ¡À

30400:
Only two different Arulco families have ever been considered to have the bloodlines worthy of power. The Chivaldori and the Cordona families. ¡À

31200:
The Chivaldori family ruled Arulco for over 120 years with the exception of the period between 1938 and 1948, when Pepe Cordona was elected king. ¡À

32000:
It has been widely documented that the switch in kings was due to the population's belief that the Chivaldori family was too pacifistic to deal with a world at war. The nation believed the Cordona family had the fortitude to lead them through the turmoil. ¡À

32800:
At the end of the Cordona family's first ten-year term, the world was at peace again and the reigning king lost the 1948 election, removing the Cordonas from power. ¡À

33600:
The Cordona family subsequently returned to their hometown of Omerta. Feeling bitter and cheated, they began a peaceful political campaign to reinstate their family as the rulers of Arulco. ¡À

34400:
Andreas Chivaldori governed Arulco from 1948 until 1988, when he decided it was time for his only child, Enrico, to succeed him. It has been said that the King's ill-health, the Queen's death, and the discovery of gold and silver in the countryside, all pushed Andreas to cede the throne to his well-educated son. ¡À ¡À ¡À ¡À

35200:
The election in 1988, however, was expected to be extremely close. Enrico Chivaldori faced an extremely popular opponent by the name of Miguel Cordona. ¡À

36000:
¡À It has been reported, the King felt his son should take a bride. A wedding would have a strong, positive influence on the election, thus guaranteeing a Chivaldori victory. The King was confident that his son had the compassion and qualifications to ensure the wealth from the mines would be distributed fairly amongst the populace. ¡À ¡À ¡À

36800:
A discreet, yet hasty, international search was carried out for a woman of the right pedigree. Deidranna Reitman of Romanian decent was chosen. ¡À

37600:
Recon Department could obtain no further information on Deidranna Reitman as all records appear to have been destroyed. A search for family members and friends, however continues. Any further information obtained will be forwarded. ¡À

38400:
Within a year of Enrico being elected King, his father, Andreas Chivaldori was found dead in his bed. The autopsy results established poisoning as the cause of death. A significant amount of circumstantial evidence led to the arrest and imprisonment of Enrico Chivaldori for the murder of his father. ¡À

39200:
On the night before Enrico's trial, four armed escorts were firebombed while transferring Enrico to the courthouse. Palace officials blamed Enrico's assassination on Miguel's rebel forces, asserting this violent act was committed to conceal their involvement in the murder of Andreas Chivaldori. ¡À

40000:
¡À ¢æ Intelligence ¢æ ¡À

40800:
(Please note that the following is highly speculative information.) ¡À

41600:
Unconfirmed sources claim that the four guards had been ordered to turn Enrico Chivaldori over to the Omerta rebel camp rather than deliver him to the courthouse. Queen Deidranna was certain that Miguel Cordona would kill Enrico thus eliminating 'this enemy of Arulco' and the only remaining member of the Chivaldori family. ¡À

42400:
Five severely charred bodies were found in front of the courthouse the morning of the trial, and two of them were positively identified as members of the escort team. This evidence alone prompted the conclusion that Enrico had died in the aforementioned firebomb attack. ¡À

43200:
Nine years of rule under Queen Deidranna has left the country in a shambles. It has suffered greatly under her iron fist, and there have been reports of unspeakable exploitation, cruelty, and genocide. ¡À

44000:
All members of the judicial system have been executed. The rule of law has become the law of death. What is considered a crime is determined at Deidranna's whim and no matter the crime's severity, the usual punishment is death. ¡À

44800:
Somewhat substantiated rumors assert that Deidranna has been researching and stockpiling weapons of mass destruction for an undetermined purpose. ¡À

45600:
¡À The population has been living in constant fear. They have grown accustomed to witnessing the fateful results from the slightest hint of subversive behavior. As a result, they cannot be relied upon to assist in any sort of military retaliatory action. ¡À ¡À

46400:
¢æ Recent Events ¢æ ¡À

47200:
Miguel Cordona's rebel force has begun to receive outside funding to purchase the arms necessary to engage in small-scale skirmishes. ¡À

48000:
Queen Deidranna canceled the election that was due to be held in 1998. Within the same decree, she declared herself ruler for life. ¡À

48800:
Six months ago, Arulco's military forces attacked the Omerta rebel base. It is believed it was totally destroyed, although there have been unconfirmed reports of survivors. ¡À ¡À

49600:
