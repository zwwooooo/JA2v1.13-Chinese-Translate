Hello baby!

480:
Can I pull their legs off with my bare hands, please?

960:
Yeah! Gimme more! More! More!

1440:
C'mere bug!

1920:
Nothing! I have fried bigger bugs in the junkyard. Let's cook it.

2400:
Dis reminds me of my room at home. My dad was always on me.

2880:
Oh oh, someone say something?

3360:
Now that's my kinda smell!

3840:
Ooh, the hair on my back rises in excitement.

4320:
Little buggies come out come out wherever you are...

4800:
You're all gonna die trying, bugs!

5280:
Something!

5760:
Lookie!

6240:
I hate dis. More bullets.

6720:
I've never seen my intestines! What... is that? Kinda long...

8160:
Oh, no. Dis is bad. Dis is bad. Very bad. Foxy, Foxy, Foxy. Oh, Foxy. Uhh, what's the chance of puttin' her in ice?

8640:
Whoa. I hit myself in the head. What was I doing again?

9120:
It's jammed. Maybe I can suck the bullet out.

9600:
Ah ha ha ha! Morons!

10080:
Dat was almost as good as sex.

10560:
I love the excitement.

11040:
Personally, I'll shoot at anything. Just don't expect me to hit it.

11520:
Hey! Blood! Now I can fingerpaint!

12000:
Hey. I didn't get my afternoon nap. I'm starting to feel it.

12480:
Whoa. Next time I kill someone, I take their lungs.

12960:
Did it hurt, moron?

13440:
Rather kill a human.

15840:
Whoa, got brain in my mouth! Uh, say... sweet.

16320:
Every once in a while, I need to pull my own hair out. I don't know why, but it grows back.

16800:
That was boring. Next?

17280:
Stick it in your ass!

17760:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Bleed, you stupid bitch! You ruined everything! I hate you! I hate you! I say we all urinate on the body.

18240:
Ah ha ha! Scrambled eggs for everyone!

18720:
Shut up, or I'll peel your eyelids back.

19200:
I'm bored out my bug-balled tree...

19680:
Sure, they look at me like I am something of a crazy man, but THEY are the crazy ones! One day, I will kill them all.

20160:
Bombers!

20640:
I'd be better off using an old bumper from the junkyard then dis crap! Is junk! And I know junk!

21120:
You know, it's fun to kill everything.

22080:
It doesn't matter.

22560:
Sounds like a plan.

23040:
What happened?

25440:
Foxy, you are one sexy lady. Look at you go.

25920:
Where's my money?

26400:
Dis is it! No money? No Maddog. I kill her myself, for myself, for free.

26880:
Hey! All is black now!

27360:
Why am I bothering with this?

27840:
I don't get it. Why is he friendly? What's his problem?

28320:
We're going to see action. As soon as they show their heads, I'll let 'em have it!

28800:
Let's just fire wildly 'til they come out of their hiding spot.

29760:
How can people question my love for this?

30240:
There's the runaway. I bet he think this is funny. I will pull his cheeks out a foot from his face. See if he laughs then.

30720:
I don't care. This team crap wasn't for me anyway.

31200:
Hahahaha! They all fell like pantyhose from a five dollar woman.

31680:
Hey! I think someone's been in the box. I'm gonna put 'em back in it, too, just as soon as I find out who it is.

32160:
If I had the time, I would've had some fun with her first, but...

32640:
Carpet!

33120:
It was fun! Where do I sign up to make career of this? Hard to believe they pay money too.

33600:
The babies ran away!

34080:
Okay, I get sleep. Gotta get rid of the shakes.

34560:
I'm feeling like daisy.

35040:
Me first.

35520:
If it wasn't already broken, I'd break this damn thing.

36000:
Oooh! Let somebody else do it. Someone I don't like.

36480:
Oooh! Looks like someone left something for us!

36960:
Hey. Look at... <glub> the pretty fish... <glub> hey...

37440:
I'm here. I ate every bug on the way. There were many.
