Our friends are here again...

480:
Time to work...

960:
Holy Shit...

1440:
Can you see what I see? Maggot alarm!

1920:
Holy Shit! I have an insect allergy - is that a maggot?

2400:
Well, it wasn't wolves - could be maggots...

2880:
Sshh, hear that?

3360:
I believe these insects cripple their enemies with their smell.

3840:
It's too quiet for my liking...

4320:
I think the maggots are near.

4800:
C'MON...I'm your natural enemy - you don't believe it, eh?

5280:
Something there!

5760:
What's that there?

6240:
Out of ammo! Reload!

6720:
Won't last long without a medic...

7200:
Verdammt Rudolf...I never thought they would get YOU. 

7680:


8160:
Fidel, you're not dead! C'mon, stop acting!  Neiiin! He IS dead!

8640:
What did I just want?

9120:
Damn gun's jammed!

9600:
Heavy shit here...

10080:
That was hard to take...

10560:
A near miss there...!

11040:
No line of fire!

11520:
I must stop this bleeding - fast.

12000:
I really need some sleep.

12480:
I need to breathe...

12960:
It's all over for you...

13440:
Ha! At last...

13920:
I can take punishment - what I CAN'T take is that verdammt New-Age Thor. He better put his dick in his mouth...schnell.

14400:


14880:
We have AT LEAST TWO lunatics here...there's Numb of course...- and the guy who hired him!

15360:
Auf Wiedersehen, Mikey boy.

15840:
Ouh! Red white and gray - and you're NOT ok! Heh-heh-heh

16320:


16800:
Ready.

17280:
I will not do that.

17760:
She wasn't my type anyway.

18240:
Jaaa! That finishes the monster maggot!

18720:
I think it's time for a change - an idiot-free occupation this time...

19200:
Arulco, hah...how interesting...

19680:
This here is the company my Mom always warned me about....

20160:
Air raid!

20640:
They seem to think we don't need good equipment. I don't like that...

21120:
This team has a lot to learn...but they don't put their minds to it...

21600:


22080:
Not bad....I'm getting even better!

22560:
We could send Deidranna a fax with our attack plan. That would be just as effective.

23040:
Perhaps sarcasm is lost on some people...YES...the fax!

23520:
If I'd known I'd have to listen to that windbag Thor, I would NOT have been here!

24000:


24480:
Yees, Rudolf, you are the MAAAAN!

24960:


25440:
That Fidel is priceless! Did you SEE THAT?

25920:
To extend now? Too early, I think. 

26400:
Holy Shit! Mike?

26880:
What the hell...my eyes...burning...I'm blind!!

27360:
Cannot be done!

27840:
Quite pleasant, these people.

28320:
Enemy presence...be alert.

28800:
The enemy is still here - you must be careful.

29280:
What's this?

29760:
Good workmanship...

30240:
Hey, that looks like Joey! After him!

30720:
We have come to bring order to Arulco. You can depend on us to help you.

31200:
Enemy eliminated - now we can look around in peace...

31680:
Someone has been playing with our shipment.   Corrupt bastards!

32160:
She was definitely NOT better class...

32640:
A big cat...

33120:
This was a good and important mission, perfectly organised and commanded. I enjoyed it. I would like to work with this team again.

33600:
Not all of the enemy are dead, but there are no more here. I believe they have retreated.

34080:
I'm losing my concentration...time to rest.

34560:
Now I'm ready.

35040:
And another here!

35520:
This THING isn't working.

36000:
Looks like a booby trap.

36480:
Something suspicious on the ground there.

36960:
Verdammt..I'm going down...

37440:
Have arrived - await instructions.

37920:


38400:
I expect outstanding qualities from a commander. From what I hear, you are lacking in that department.

38880:
You lose too many good men - not interested

39360:
Sorry, I'm writing a poem for my girl...and you can't interrupt genius at work.

39840:
Oh, what a shame. If I had known that....mmmm. Remember I am a mercenary - so ask earlier next time, ja?

40320:
Here is Henning von Branitz. I am not available at present. Please  leave a message after the tone.

40800:
Looks like we're finished here. I wish you luck.

41280:
Thor is with you too? Then I must decline. You will find out why. I wish you good luck....you'll need it...

41760:


42240:
Nein! ... One mission with Numb is enough. Some people cannot learn, but he...he is a crazy shithead. No! NO chance! .

42720:
I would suggest a contract extension, what do you think?

43200:
Agreed!

43680:
I'm on my way.

44160:
You managed to get Rudolf? It will be a pleasure to work with him...even  in spite of certain doubts I have...

44640:


45120:
Perhaps I'm making a mistake, but I won't miss out on the chance of a mission with Fidel

45600:
I never thought you would ever ask me to work for you again...I live and learn!

46080:
I said...

46560:
The word merc means mercenary - and THAT means money. I don't work for charities...

47040:
This is bad for the reputation...

47520:
So, you are as rich as Croesus...one guy dies, you buy another, fine.  But for me your death rate is too high - much too high...

48000:
I have a bad feeling about that Thor...like repairing his face by force.. A contract extension? No chance.

48480:


48960:
You want to know in a word why I'm not renewing.......NUMB!

49440:
Rudolf and me are a good team. I can't say that about many I know... In other words, I'm in.

49920:


50400:
When I was an instructor on Cuba, I knew a guy like Fidel.  Good times...so because of Fidel I'll sign up...but for the record - it's not because I find your mission so attractive.

50880:
I said...

51360:
Your bank account is shitty - impossible.

51840:
Hello!

52320:


52800:
I don't have all the time in the world...

53280:
How long should the contract be?

53760:
Call again - but only when you know what you want.

54240:
I'm telling you now - I HATE working with Thor.

54720:


55200:
Just reminding you - my contract will soon be up.

55680:
I have improved yet again. And experience pays, they say...but in cash, I hope.
