0:
More opposition.

480:
Time to take out the trash!

960:
Gotta pull outta here, NOW.

1440:
BFS...Big Friggin' Slinky.

1920:
Jeezis K. Riest, that is the biggest, grossest goddamn slinky I ever did see!

2400:
Slinky's been on a rampage, man.

2880:
Just heard a noise!

3360:
Whew! That's one stinky slinky, man!

3840:
Gettin' the cold sweats. Means something heavy's about to go down.

4320:
I think them butt-ugly slinkies are around...

4800:
God damn, man, the Big Friggin' Slinkies are everywhere.

5280:
Something over there.

5760:
What is that?

6240:
This gun ain't happenin' 'til I reload it.

6720:
Feels like my insides are on fire!

8640:
Zoned out for a second. Run that by me again.

9120:
Shoot, my gun jammed!

10080:
Awright, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

10560:
Yeah, that coulda been bad, but I got me some kickass karma.

11040:
Hey, I'm good, but I'm not sure I'm THAT good.

11520:
I'm puttin' pressure on this wound, but it's still bleedin'.

12000:
I can't stop yawnin'. I gotta take a catnap, like, now.

12480:
Lemme catch my breath, before I pass out!

12960:
Tagged ya.

13440:
Unslinkified!

15840:
Oh, Jesus, now THAT blows my mind. Guess that makes two of us.

16800:
Got this wrapped up. Next!

17280:
Pff! Get someone else to do it.

17760:
HAHAHA! Rest in pieces, you evil thing!

18240:
Awright, baby! Big Mama ugly-ass slimy slinky bites the big one!

18720:
If there's a worse merc than that scumbag, I ain't met 'em.

19200:
Somebody put me outta my misery before I do it to myself, would ya?

19680:
This company, talk about scrapin' the bottom of the barrel for mercs!

20160:
They're making a bombing run!

20640:
I hate going into battle with stuff I can't trust. This is the flimsiest crap I've ever been asked to use.

22080:
Some of us just have it.

22560:
Gotta be kiddin' me. Wanna do WHAT?

23040:
Didn't really expect that to work, didja?

26400:
Talk about flying in low. I had to look up to see the squirrels. I'm sure glad to have my feet planted firmly on the ground. Now, which way to the rebel hideout?

26880:
Need a guide. I can't see nothin'!

27360:
This just ain't gonna happen.

27840:
Those are the kind of people I'm fighting for.

28320:
This is a guaranteed combat area. Got enemies.

28800:
Remember, there's at least one hiding somewhere nearby.

29280:
Bingo. It's just like Christmas.

30240:
That's the milk carton kid! Joey whatever...

30720:
Not if we take her out first. Let me tell ya, most women I take out don't even know how to read a map.

31200:
Yeah! This is an enemy-free zone.

31680:
We've been short-shipped or finger-slipped! Either way, there's stuff missing.

32160:
It was either that or an armful of Midol. And I didn't see no pharmacies. Don't sweat it, we'll be heroes around here.

32640:
Pussy!

33120:
Yeah! Now that's the way to show 'em who's boss! It was good to be part of it. Hard to believe it's already over.

33600:
Ah, they're up to something else now. Not here anymore.

34080:
Grabbing a catnap 'fore I smack my head off the floor.

34560:
Yup, I'm back on it.

35040:
Deal me in, too!

35520:
It's broken! How 'bout we stop shopping outta dumpsters?

36000:
That thing's wound up tight enough to take an arm.

36480:
Hey, would ya look at that? Don't look right to me.

36960:
I'm going down... fast!

37440:
End of the road. I'm just standing here waitin'.

37920:
Never know how much ya miss a computer till ya go without porno. I'm glad ours is working again.

38400:
That... pilot better be dead!

38880:
Lucky? You're lucky I don't kick your ass, ya bush pilot idiot!

39360:
I vote we move out, now.

39840:
Looks like we gotta go back where we came from and deal with that door. Though, I thought maybe we'd find something up here.

40320:
I'm not going anywhere, cause there ain't anywhere to go, sir.

40800:
Jeezis K. Riest! It's bone-chillin'! You could use my family jewels to keep drinks cold.

41280:
Ground zero! One good blast and these guys won't be poppin' out of the rocks anymore.

41760:
Who would want to live here?

42240:
Got my fingers crossed the snow's behind us. I think my plans for fatherhood may have been altered though.

42720:
Let's see here... we're a head or two short. Probably, didn't make it through the fan.

43200:
Blowing our way in was safer than strolling through the fan, but definitely not as quiet.

43680:
Awright! Looks like everyone's got a seat for the finale.

44160:
What's her chance of being employee of the month?

44640:
A good ass-kicking might just get this gunrunner thinkin' a little friendlier.

45120:
La-dee-da. Got to love the last hurrah.

45600:
You realize that if it doesn't work, you'll be able to suck us through a straw.

46080:
You must know a thing or two about this country, Manuel. Feel free to cough it up.

46560:
Nothing personal, Colonel, but I'm hoping you'll do a better job for our side. The Queen Majesty herself has endorsed our mission.

47040:
I'm sure we can find some use for you, John. Just try and keep yourself outta trouble.

47520:
Were you in "The Good, the Bad, and the Asian," Tex? That was one of my favorites. Hope you're still in fighting shape.

48000:
I've always wanted to fire-off a couple of rounds with one of these.

48480:
I'd rather be looking down the barrel of a M16, than taking a stroll through that fan.

48960:
Looks like the fat lady is done singing.

49440:
Give me that paper!

49920:
Unbelievable! A work of art! And with that our work is done here.

50400:
We got new meat. Should have known the guard station wouldn't be the end of it.

50880:
This thing should be in a museum. Wonder if it still works?

51360:
That's it! If she's got any more problems with wildlife, she's on her own.

51840:
Ha ha! He had me worried for a second. Until his head flew over my shoulder, that is.

52320:
Problem is I don't think he left anything behind. Nothing useable anyway.

52800:
Wish there was cutters, so we could get in quiet. But that ain't gonna happen!

53280:
Now that's one serious door!

53760:
That moved something downstairs. I heard it.

54240:
What the hell is that all about?

54720:
That's the sound we been waiting for... Time to do it.

55200:
Aha... This is what he was gonna use to fire the missiles into Arulco. Got the coordinates for pretty much every town. I bet I could operate the control panel and plug some of my own numbers in...

55680:
Like the ones for this place. End this whole story with one good blast! Just need a quick way out of here... Hey - that elevator should do the trick.
