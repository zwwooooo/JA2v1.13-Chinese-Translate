At IMP, we know the mercenary trade. We know the pressures you're under, and we know what it takes - advice you won't find at any candyass "pc" site. Our profiles are designed to elicit honest answers, accurate results and information you need to know. ¡À

3200:
¢æ Why you need us: ¢æ As professional armed "servicemen", you need psychological profiling (and sometimes counseling) to get ahead in your profession and to use your God-and-Smith-&-Wesson given talents to their fullest potential. IMP takes you there. ¡À

3840:
¢æ What you get: ¢æ IMP analyzes you scientifically. We look at your personality, your skills, your physical attributes ... right down to voice and portrait identification. You get a look at your character, an in-depth profile of who you are and what makes you tick (or get clocked). ¡À

4480:
¢æ How much: ¢æ WITH THIS SPECIAL EMAIL OFFER, you get it all for only $3,000! A savings of $2,500 off regularly advertised prices! ¡À

Law Enforcement Agencies are requested to note that this is for entertainment only, and IMP does not (in any way that can be proven in a court of law - technically) supply actual mercenaries. ¡À

I packed the gifts I promised you the other day. Sent them Express courier so they should be in Calisto by now. I also have some information passed on from a contact. Be on the lookout for someone named Mike. It appears Crepaton hired him to locate the disc I was transporting. ¡À

Anyway, pop in for coffee and scones anytime. ¡À ¡À Thanks again, ¡À John Blair ¡À
