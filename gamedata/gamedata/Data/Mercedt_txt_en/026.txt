Boneheads.

480:
They're here, man.

960:
Up to my armpits here, Bub.

1440:
Got a crawler! Man, I hate those things.

1920:
Big bummer! I've seen one of those before, man. I think it was, ah...'67, or ah, '69. Of course, then it wasn't real.

2400:
Those things got a nasty case of the munchies. They give me the willies, man.

2880:
Pretty sure I picked up noise, man.

3360:
<sniff> Wasn't me, man. I swear!

3840:
Gotta keep a clear head around here.

4320:
I hate this! Place is probably crawling with them crawlers.

4800:
Bummer! I'm livin' my nightmare, man.

5280:
Check this out.

5760:
Goodies here.

6240:
Ammo's spent, man.

6720:
Took it really bad, man... I need some medical attention...like now.

7200:
That's too bad, man. Larry seemed to be in a really good mood the past couple of days.

7680:
Oh that's one big drag, man. Spider was like the girl next door with like a medical degree on her wall to boot, man. Gonna miss her.

8640:
What's happenin'?

9120:
This ain't cool! My gun's broken, man.

9600:
Takin' heat, man!

10080:
Gonna be a long night, man.

10560:
That sucks.

11040:
I don't know. Don't look in the bag to me, man.

11520:
I'm staring at blood, man... my BLOOD!

12000:
Need to crash, man.

12480:
Hunh, woah. I'm wheezing.

12960:
I'm smokin'.

13440:
That's a relief.

13920:
Larry ain't right. He just ain't cool. He ain't the dude I used to know. Makes me sick to my stomach.

14400:
Something about Stephen that just reeks, man. He's just a little too...too. I can't put my finger on it, man.

14880:
Razor's on the edge...the stress level is like unnecessary, man. So keep some distance between us.

15360:
A.I.M.'s got another opening, man.

15840:
Had like a firework effect to it. Even made a kind of a chillin' pop sound, man.

16320:
I hate bugs, man. Especially bugs that are bigger than me.

16800:
I'm up-to-date, man!

17280:
I didn't quite get that... well, okay, I did... but I'm ignoring it.

17760:
That was like SO anti-climactic, man.

18240:
I think we should burn it just to be sure, man.

18720:
Conceived in something on wheels for sure, man.

19200:
I've had more fun clipping my toe nails.

19680:
This team is like losers anonymous.

20160:
Look out! They're attacking from above, man.

20640:
Bet somebody used this equipment in 'Nam, man.

21120:
It'd be kinda cool just to hangout down here.

21600:
The Swiss tick me off, man. I think it's 'cause they're just too damn neutral. You know, kinda like cardboard people.

22080:
I sort of felt something, man.

22560:
Might want to take a look at that on paper, man.

23040:
I'm stunned.

23520:
Larry's turned into one preachy pain in the ass. If you really feel ya need him, keep us apart, man.

24000:
Keep that Swiss desk jockey, Stephen, clear of me. I wouldn't be here if I'd known he was coming, man.

24480:
Larry's just so cool, man...you think his head's elsewhere, bingo! He comes through.

24960:
Two thumbs up, Spider!

25920:
Be patient, man... we'll get around to it.

26400:
So... this is where Mike's been working.

26880:
Got creature pee in my eyes, man!

27360:
This is a waste of time, man.

27840:
Seemed kinda cool.

28320:
Nice and slow, man... boneheads been detected in this area.

28800:
Tired of chasing 'em, man. They'll rear their ugly heads soon enough.

29760:
Ya just earned yourself a good cleaning, Mister gun.

30240:
Over there! Isn't that the momma's boy?

30720:
Hey man, good to be here. Rebels, hunh? Cool. Hey don't you worry, Miguel. We'll smoke her out.

31200:
Show's over baby. They're just pushing up weeds now.

31680:
You know, I don't think everything's here, dude.

32160:
Didn't have no choice, man... She wasn't gonna change.

32640:
Cat's on 'roids!

33120:
Man, I love this stuff. I can't get no high like it. I mean that, man. I'm gonna miss all of you. Gimme a call sometime, okay?

33600:
They caught the big wave outta here, dude.

34080:
My lids are heavy, man. Gotta catch a few.

34560:
Needed that sleep, man. I'm ready to work now.

35040:
Man, me too.

35520:
This thing ain't working.

36000:
Chill out. This thing is rigged.

36480:
Man, I don't like the way that ground looks at all.

36960:
Surf's way, way up! To up, man... I'm going under... drowning...

37440:
Traveling's over, man. I'm ready for whatever.

38400:
You've pulled some bonehead moves in the past, man. I'm gonna hang low for a bit and see what else comes up.

38880:
You got quite the collection of bodies, man. Think I'll pass on that offer.

39360:
It's out of the question, man. They're dedicating a park to Garcia this weekend. My presence is like required.

39840:
I gotta scoot back home. Can't change my plans on such short notice, man.

40320:
You're connected with Static, man. Can't yak right now, but let me know where I can find ya, and we'll touch base.

40800:
Hope I lived up to your expectations, man. Call me sometime, we'll yak.

41280:
I can't work with Larry, man. He's been lecturing me on the twelve steps to straightness, man. It's pathetic and annoying.

41760:
That dude Rothman makes me ill. Don't work with consultants, man. I want somebody beside me who can take a bullet, not tell ME how to.

42240:
Razor is like certifiable, man. One dangerous dude. I ain't comfy working beside him.

42720:
What you thinkin', man? 'Cause I was kinda thinkin' I'd be willing to stick around for a while longer, if you're interested.

43200:
Cool. Didn't feel much like packin' anyway.

43680:
I'm game, man. Catch ya soon.

44160:
I'll take a chance on you. Larry seems to be back to his normal self. It'll be just like the old days, man.

44640:
Okay, why not. Spider's on the team, and I like her style.

45600:
You're kiddin', right man? Gotta be! I can't get outta here fast enough.

46080:
Like I was saying, man...

46560:
Ah, we got a problem, man. Your bank put the brakes to the deal. It's too bad, man.

47040:
I was just gettin' used to the water, man.

47520:
You got quite the collection of bodies, man. Think I'll pass on that offer.

48000:
I can't work with Larry, man. He's been lecturing me on the twelve steps to straightness, man. It's pathetic and annoying.

48480:
That dude Rothman makes me ill. Don't work with consultants, man. I want somebody beside me who can take a bullet, not tell ME how to.

48960:

49440:
I'll take a chance on you. Larry seems to be back to his normal self. It'll be just like the old days, man.

49920:
Okay, why not. Spider's on the team, and I like her style.

50880:
Like I was saying, man...

51360:
Ah, we got a problem, man. Your bank put the brakes to the deal. It's too bad, man.

51840:
Kirk Stevenson here. Otherwise known as Static. I used to answer that way, but everybody thought I was talking about havin' a poor video connection.

52320:
I work best in the dark, man... I make sure everybody knows that, including the ladies.

52800:
Take your time, man.

53280:
You can really save big bucks on the long-term stuff, man.

53760:
I've lost interest, man. Maybe another time.

54720:
I'm gonna be up-front about this, man. Me and that Swiss, Stephen, don't see eye-to-eye, if you know what I mean. I'll take the gig, but you gotta remember what I told ya, man.

55200:
High-tide on my contract, man. It's almost up.

55680:
You gotta figure experience is worth a few bucks more, man, so I upped my price.
