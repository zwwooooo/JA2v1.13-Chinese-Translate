0:
Opposition.

480:
A lion is now in our path.

960:
They are relentless in their pursuit!

1440:
Scutter bug is here.

1920:
If I were superstitious, I might well see these fearsome scuttering insects as omens of doom. But they are no more or less portentous than man himself.

2400:
Signs of the scuttering beasts.

2880:
Something stirs just beyond.

3360:
Eugh. The scutter bugs have cast their sickly scent here.

3840:
Trouble whispers on the breeze. Be prepared.

4320:
I pray the scutter bugs are absent. I have no wish to die like a fly in a web.

4800:
The scutter bugs want to devour me!

5280:
Something.

5760:
What lies there?

6240:
I am in search of ammunition for my weapon.

6720:
I cast aside the pain of my injuries.

8160:
Victoria Waters, you were a woman of honor and spirit. May your soul's journey be met with happiness.

8640:
I have forgotten my instructions.

9120:
This weapon has jammed.

9600:
Assistance! I doubt I can prevail alone!

10080:
The discomfort will pass.

10560:
I shall not fear death when it finally greets me.

11040:
A highly doubtful shot.

11520:
I must not continue to lose blood.

12000:
The need for sleep must not be denied.

12480:
I must recover my breath.

12960:
That enemy breathes no more.

13440:
The bug's soul is at peace.

15360:
Mike has now passed on... his soul of betrayal has found peace at last.

15840:
That is a spirit that will never rest.

16800:
I need guidance.

17280:
That, I will not do.

17760:
In death, as in life, the harridan's spirit shrieked for release.

18240:
I'm honored to be the instrument of the scutter queen's death.

18720:
Such a fool.

19200:
My valor is wasted here.

19680:
I cannot but laugh at this army of clowns.

20160:
The enemy has taken to the air!

20640:
The quality of this equipment is a hindrance. It is almost worse than no equipment at all.

21120:
I prefer to anticipate the worst so that I am never disappointed.

22080:
There is no teacher greater than experience.

22560:
Why do you contrive to fail?

23040:
I humbly suggest you consult Chapter 11 of Sun Tzu.

25440:
I could sense Vicki's potential for greatness. It shines from within.

25920:
That might be a hasty decision. Let us see how events unfold.

26400:
Well, well, we are facing our friend Mike. This was meant to be; there are no coincidences.

26880:
Grave danger awaits. I cannot see what surrounds me.

27360:
The requirements surpass my capabilities.

27840:
There is something rather unique about that man.

28320:
This territory contains evil that must be confronted.

28800:
We have not rid this sphere of its evil. We must remain prepared.

29760:
I am forever spellbound by the frailty of life.

30240:
It appears to be the young Graham boy. His wild streak most likely stems from an inner confusion. With time, it too shall pass.

30720:
Each person is placed into another's path for a purpose, Miguel. And so ours have crossed, and now fate shall determine the outcome.

31200:
It is most favorable. The evil souls that inhabited this place have all been sent on their final journey.

31680:
The shipment is not complete. He who takes what is not his is destined to live a shorter existence. All that is left is to determine his identity.

32160:
The winds of karma brought back to her what she had set upon so many others. Our deed here will strengthen us, and relieve the people of a terrible burden.

32640:
Hunger prowls!

33120:
The Art of War states that a man may be successful if he follows a certain way of thinking. This gives me great joy now. For our mission, that which is now complete, the spirits are pleased. With most of us anyway.

33600:
The cowards flee! We are at peace momentarily.

34080:
A mind without sleep is without focus. I shall rest, then return to the task at hand.

34560:
I place into my work what slumber has provided.

35040:
Our minds think alike.

35520:
Performance is limited by the performance of our tools. I am, at this moment, useless.

36000:
We must examine this more closely, but with extreme caution.

36480:
Look there. The ground reveals the evil plan.

36960:
He... who dies... in water <gulb>... dies.

37440:
My journey has come to a successful conclusion.

38400:
I cannot join you. I seek a general that is wise in the ways of war.

38880:
I cannot accept. I believe you are reckless with the lives of your men.

39360:
Regretfully, I will be on retreat. I am sorry.

39840:
I must sorrowfully decline. I am participating in the review of a new treatment. Remember, asking for me in advance increases the possibility that I will be available.

40320:
Doctor Q. Huaong speaking. I regret I have missed your call. Should you wish, you may leave your message for me here, and I'll return it, or you may simply call me again at another time.

40800:
I'm pleased to have been of service. Perhaps we will work together again.

42720:
The end of our mutual agreement draws close. Do you wish to discuss an extension?

43200:
The renewal is agreeable to me.

43680:
The arrangement is mutually beneficial. I agree to the terms.

45120:
I question some of your decisions. Nevertheless, I will defer to the judgement of Victoria Waters, whom I have learned to trust. I agree to the arrangement.

45600:
Your ignorance of the art of war betrays your own men. I do not accept.

46080:
I repeat,...

46560:
I don't wish to embarrass you but there are financial considerations you have not fully taken into account.

47040:
I withdraw. Luck be with you and especially with your army.

47520:
I cannot accept. I believe you are reckless with the lives of your men.

50400:
I question some of your decisions. Nevertheless, I will defer to the judgement of Victoria Waters, whom I have learned to trust. I agree to the arrangement.

50880:
I repeat...

51360:
I don't wish to embarrass you, but there are financial considerations you have not fully taken into account.

51840:
Dr. Q. Huaong speaking.

52320:
Perhaps these video phones make you self-conscious. I know they have the same effect on me.

52800:
I cannot help you if you refuse to tell me what you want.

53280:
I'm prepared to offer you several alternatives.

53760:
Indecision is not becoming of a leader. Please call when you have corrected this flaw.

55200:
Our agreement draws toward its end. Of this, you should be aware.

55680:
An ancient proverb says that as a man increases in experience, so too shall his fee. I have great respect for proverbs.
