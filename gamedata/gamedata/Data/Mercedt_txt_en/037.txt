0:
Unfriendly.

480:
I knew they'd show up sooner or later.

960:
I could use some help.

1440:
Insect!

1920:
Look at the size of those things! I sure hope the next step up the food chain doesn't hang out here too.

2400:
I'd love to take a magnifying glass to those blasted insects. Just like I used to do to ants when I was a kid.

2880:
What did I hear?

3360:
Ugghh, that smell... it's far worse than any latrine I've ever been in. Even after I was finished.

3840:
Let's keep our wits about us. I'm tensing up.

4320:
Something tells me those killer insects are gonna show.

4800:
If they kill me, at least I'll know the bastards are getting forty pounds less meat.

5280:
What's this?

5760:
Got something here.

6240:
Bullets would be helpful.

6720:
I got no sensation in my legs. Ugh, don't think I can move.

7200:
That hurts. Fox and I were an item. She's the reason I lost all that weight.

7680:
I'm gonna miss not having Lynx around. He saved my butt on more than one occasion.

8640:
Come again.

9120:
Weapon misfired.

9600:
Takin' heat.

10080:
That smarts.

10560:
Wasn't all THAT close.

11040:
The odds suck.

11520:
Got a bleeder!

12000:
Uhhh, I'm beat. I could use some sleep.

12480:
Thought I was... in better shape.

12960:
I'm crying.

13440:
Problem... eliminated.

14880:
You look at a guy like Numb, and ya know his dad didn't kick his ass often enough.

15360:
All right! I got to remember to get A.I.M. to put that in my bio.

15840:
Lovely! Just freakin' lovely.

16800:
That's wrapped up.

17280:
Ask someone else.

17760:
Killing the head villain is always satisfying. Even more so when it's a broad.

18240:
Now... maybe this country can sleep.

18720:
What a numbnuts.

19200:
I can think of a thousand places I'd rather be than here.

19680:
Ya meet all kinds down here.

20160:
Bombers overhead!

20640:
Second-rate crap. That's what I get for equipment.

21120:
Ya know, most of us aren't gonna leave here alive.

22080:
That's encouraging.

22560:
What are ya on? Dope?

23040:
Like anyone thought there was a chance of that working.

24480:
Good one, Foxtrot!

24960:
That's Lynx for ya.

25920:
Hold on to your socks. I need a bit more time to mull it over.

26400:
Holy slimeball! It's Mike.

26880:
Damn! All I see are bright flashes.

27360:
I'm gettin' nowhere.

27840:
Good attitude. I like that.

28320:
Be prepared. We've got unfriendlies in this sector.

28800:
Stay alert. They'll probably pop out the moment we drop our guard.

29760:
Firepower. The difference between life and death.

30240:
I'm sure that's Joey Graham, the runaway. Time to put an end to his fun.

30720:
Doubt she'll get far, Miguel, we're ready. I'm going to take that crown right off of her head personally.

31200:
That's all of them. Nothing left but funerals here.

31680:
Hmm. Seems someone's helped themselves. Gonna chop off their hands when I catch 'em.

32160:
Now you're just like your sex life: cold, dead and lying in the bed you made.

32640:
Savage cat!

33120:
If nothing else, this proved one thing - all of my training paid off. And, you know, something else, too. Leadership, good leadership. Don't get a fat head over it, but nice work.

33600:
Ah, they pulled out. Sector's secure.

34080:
Ya know, no sleep, no focus. I'll just take five here.

34560:
Yeah. Things are a little clearer. Back to work.

35040:
Echo that.

35520:
Hey, this Happy Meal crap broke. It ain't gonna get the job done.

36000:
Whoa! Got boom written all over this.

36480:
Hold up! That doesn't look too convincing to me. Dangerous, but not convincing.

36960:
Noooo! <glub> Tell... Fox... I...cared.

37440:
Made it in one piece. What's the story now...

38400:
I don't think so. We do talk to each other, ya know. And no one had much good to say about you.

38880:
I can't agree to it. Our side's piling up the corpses, and in my opinion, it's mostly due to your recklessness.

39360:
Won't be able to make it. Got a PoundShedders meeting tonight. It's the monthly weigh-in, and I'm due for a pin.

39840:
Can't stick around. Had I known sooner, I could have cancelled my mother's visit, but she's already at my place waitin' for me.

40320:
This is Wolf. You'll have to talk to my machine.

40800:
Enjoyed working for ya. Now that you know I can do pretty much anything, you give me a shout if ya need me again.

42240:
I can't see myself signing on as long as Numb is on the payroll.

42720:
I need to know what your contract intentions are. I've got people waiting.

43200:
Consider it done.

43680:
Can't wait to get there.

44160:
No matter who she's working for, Fox is worth working with. I'm in.

44640:
I've got a few problems with your operation. But, you are smart enough to have Lynx as a member of your team... Okay, I'm in.

45600:
Working for you is far too painful to repeat.

46080:
It's like this...

46560:
Cancel everything. I heard from your bank. I think we both know what I'm talking about.

47040:
Too bad. I thought I was gonna park it down here for a while. Oh well...

47520:
I can't agree to it. Our side's piling up the corpses, and in my opinion, it's mostly due to your recklessness.

48960:
I can't see myself signing on as long as Numb is on the payroll.

49440:
No matter who she's working for, Fox is worth working with. I'm in.

49920:
I've got a few problems with your operation. But, you are smart enough to have Lynx as a member of your team... Okay, I'm in.

50880:
It's like this...

51360:
Cancel everything. I heard from your bank. I think we both know what I'm talking about.

51840:
Wolf here.

52320:
Nobody does anything like I do.

52800:
I'm gonna have to eat at some point.

53280:
What kinda time frame did ya have in mind?

53760:
I got a life to get back to. Maybe you should find yourself one, too.

55200:
I'm looking at packing my bags shortly.

55680:
New contracts, new rates. Figure I'm worth few extra dollars now.
