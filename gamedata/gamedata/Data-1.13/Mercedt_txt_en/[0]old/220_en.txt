Another customer!

480:
Where's my pepper spray?

960:
There's a line-up.

1440:
Shoot em!

1920:
I don't think so...

2400:
I don't think so...

2880:
There's a mad rush

3360:
I don't think so...

3840:
It looks like it could be trouble.

4320:
I don't think so...

4800:
Where's my pepper spray?

5280:
More stuff.

5760:
More stuff.

6240:
No Ammo! I need a resupply!

6720:
I'm going need serious medical attention if I'm going to live to collect my disability.

7200:
I'm gonna get the son-of-a-bitch who killed Reuban and send tiny parts of his body to every state in the continental U.S. of A. Postage due!

9120:
Gun's screwed!

9600:
He doesn't know who he's shooting at!

10080:
It doesn't look like the bleeding is going to stop.

10560:
I've seen more gunfire at the postal station.

11040:
Everyone always wants the impossible.

11520:
I don't get paid enough for this.

12000:
Either I take a short break now, or I'm lying down for a long one.

12480:
I pulled out my back...

12960:
Next!

13440:
Next!

13920:
I hate snitches! I had one of those Bud Hellar types down at the postal station. Second week on the job, he disappeared. The same thing's gonna happen to Bud!

15360:
I really don't care!

15840:
That's impressive!

16320:
Ah... To hell!

16800:
It's done... Hope you're happy.

17280:
I won't be able to make it. I can't be everywhere!

17760:
I really don't care!

18240:
I really don't care!

18720:
Your butt is mine, buster! You'd better pray we never cross paths.

19200:
I was promised carnage! Plenty of carnage! Someone's gonna have to answer for this!

19680:
I could take you and that ragamuffin band of paper-pushing, numb-butted, overpaid, insignificants all by myself!

20160:
Cut me some slack!

20640:
It was broken when I got it.

22080:
Ya... I guess I could make myself available.

22560:
This mission is in the toilet!

23040:
Once I'm through with you, they'll be able to bury you in a standard, number eight, Manila envelope!

23520:
It's that good-for-nothing, snitch, Bud Hellar! Wipe the brown off your nose, Hellar!

24480:
Reuban's probably the only person on the planet who I wouldn't enjoy killing. He's cheap labor. Our country was built by guys like him.

25920:
I'm having my coffee. I'll get back to you...when I'm finished.

26400:
Where's my pepper spray?

27360:
Nothing ever does what it's supposed to do.

27840:
Haven't I seen you in somebody else's magazine?

28320:
This one's too stupid to even know I'm here!

28800:
It looks like it could be trouble.

29760:
Next!

31200:
Personally, I think we should get a bonus when things go this well.

32160:
Next!

32640:
Where's my pepper spray?

33120:
We won't be seeing anybody wearing that color any more.

33600:
We won't be seeing anybody wearing that color any more.

34080:
Oh... What a life.

34560:
Ya... You got me. Just don't go making like you own me.

35040:
You can't trust the government.

35520:
It was broken when I got it.

36000:
Now we got to get it all the way back.

36480:
Now we got to get it all the way back.

36960:
I'm going under... It's a bitch there's nobody to take with me...

37440:
Keep your eyes on the clock. I don't do overtime.
