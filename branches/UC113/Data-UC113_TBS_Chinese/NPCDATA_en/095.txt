Good day to you. I am Randolph Hearse, editor of the Danubia News as well as the Adrian Enquirer. My work is more dangerous than feeding crocodiles at the zoo.

480:
So far, this week has been terrible. One of my reporters has been arrested, and then a printing press broke down.

960:
Miranda Cruz, who calls herself Maria, promised to find some evidence about Crepaton Corporation. She and her photographer Bruce managed to get into the Adrian Crepaton offices.

1440:
It appears Bruce got away, but Miranda was arrested by their security, then handed over to the police. They took crazy risks, but it seems they found something.

1920:
If you have the Crepaton documents, I will pay well. Anything else, I don't need.

2400:
I understand Bruce is hiding just north of here, where the island factory is located, and Miranda is being questioned at our local police station.

2880:
Threatening me won't help you collect the reward I'm offering for those documents.

3360:
What could be more exciting than being a newspaper editor? Thank you, no, your line of work has no appeal to me.

3840:
I'm losing blood! Get a first aid kit! Please do it quickly!

4320:
Doing business has been a pleasure. Now I have enough evidence to reveal Crepaton's dirty secrets, thanks to you. Goodbye and good luck to you all.

4800:
Everyone down! Looks like the war has reached Port Kip!

5280:
Here is your reward. Thank you, my friends, for rescuing Miranda and recovering the documents.

5760:
Getting her out safely must have been quite a task. Are the police after you? Oh, you shot them all. Solves that dilemma nicely! Bronski won't be around to collect his payments, hehe...

6240:
After tomorrow morning's papers hit the street, I'm going to go into hiding. Crepaton are sure to come after me with a vengeance!

6720:
If you ask me, I think Crepaton runs Danubia, not our government. Talk about corruption! Well, I have a scoop to publish, again goodbye, my friends.
