My name is Carlos. Oh, the rebels asked you to talk to me.

480:
I understand you need information about the police.

960:
Please be seated. What can I serve you?

1440:
Crepaton Corporation. Sure Miranda Cruz's partner gave me a copy of what she found for safekeeping. That crowd is into deeply dubious stuff on a major scale!

1920:
Thank you. Your generosity is overwhelming, but I don't need that.

2400:
If you are interested in finding Crepaton executives, try the roads near Drassen or Rudesa. Several of them commute between research and production plants on a daily basis.

2880:
That's no way to treat someone who wants to help you.

3360:
I could not leave this job. All my brothers are also bartenders. Soon I hope to open a bar in one of the larger towns.

3840:
Help me stop this bleeding, then take me to hospital. I feel faint at seeing blood, especially my own!

4320:
A pleasure to have been useful. Sorting out a few Crepaton major players will soon raise your popularity in Danubia.

5280:
What are you interested in?

5760:
Please be seated!

I see...

12480:
Don't leave this!

14400:
I heard shots, whats going on? Hit the floor everyone!

14880:
Claudia Papanus is Crepaton's marketing director. She travels in a black limousine with lots of security, so expect resistance. Ernest Bacardi is their research and development brains.

15360:
Some of that stuff Miranda found is dynamite! Seems Crepaton are using the mental patients at Prax Psycho Hospital as guinnea pigs for their new drugs. They have a payola deal with Dr. Lecter.

15840:
Ernest Bacardi often visits the Troy greenhouse complex where they grow exotic plants as part of the formula ingredients. Crepaton are always transporting stuff about in CIA marked vans.

16320:
Our Queen has several Swiss numbered bank accounts packed with billions, while us ordinary folks are struggling to make ends meet. No one will listen 'till she's toppled from power.

16800:
There are a few honest politicians and administrators in Danubia, but they're keeping a low profile. Joey Papanus cracks down hard on anyone criticizing the regime.
