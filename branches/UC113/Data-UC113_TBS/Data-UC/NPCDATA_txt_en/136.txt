Oh... It's you again... Hello everyone. Batman and I are waiting for you guys to find that evil tyrant Brenda. Took your time getting here, didn't you!

480:
Remember me?

960:
I understand the rebels are even planning fireworks to celebrate your victory. That's why we're here, waiting for you guys to complete the mission. So 'till we meet again.... Take care and good luck.

1440:
Brenda...  Dead at last! You may not believe this, but... most of us wanted her dead! Especially me. I'm sure you'll understand later on.

1920:
It's me who should be giving YOU gifts!

2400:
Me? You want to talk to me? I don't know what to say! I'm so grateful for everything you've done.

2880:
It's a great victory you've achieved today! Relax, enjoy our city. Have fun... Celebrate!

3360:
It's not for me.

3840:
Would you... help me?

4320:
You're what I call professional mercenaries.  I'm so happy to share this brief moment with you...

4800:
I shall never forget your kindness.  Thank you!!

5280:
Whoah... Hold on...  I don't understand! Brenda's the villian this time, you crazy schmuck.

5760:
You still have a mission to complete. She's probably skulking in some dingy bunker under the palace.

6240:
Thank goodness that incompetent pretender to my throne Brenda is finished. You guys did a great job ironing her out. Now that you've created a vacancy, it seems Danubia requires the services of a new Queen.

6720:
As a special reward, here are free vouchers redeemable at any of my beauty parlors, please, no jokes..., a year's free prescription of Crepaton, and an invitation to my coronation. Hahahaha... Deidranna Lives!

7200:
Generous! Thank you!
