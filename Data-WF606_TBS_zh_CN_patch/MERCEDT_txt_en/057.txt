7680:
Ira died for cause. She will be missed by many.

8160:
I was impressed by Shadow. He would have performed well as a member of the rebel force.

8640:
It be unusual for me, but I am...lost.

9120:

9600:
They do not know they shoot at Miguel. When they stop, I will show them.

20160:
Planes! They will try to harm to us.

20640:
I am leader of rebel force. I should not be getting such junk to use.

21120:


21600:
My father, ruler of Arulco, had much bad to say about Germans. He led our people through first war of world. I cannot accept them to this day.

22080:
I become better.

22560:
I do not understand. Have you touched tequila?

23040:

31200:
Deidranna's forces be finished here. Death take them all.

31680:
It is unacceptable to find items missing from new shipment. I do not trust Pablo. He is from family of thieves.

32160:
Doreen, you left no choice with us. My people, they will understand what I had to do this day.

32640:
Bloodcat! Be careful...

33120:
