Deadbeats.

480:
Got something to shoot, Woody.

960:
Dang! I'm in it up to my eyeballs.

1440:
Dang! Another ant.

1920:
Holy horsecrap, Woodman! Ya never mentioned nuthin' about gigantic bugs!

2400:
Dang bugs chowed down.

2880:
Shhh! Picking up noise, Woody.

3360:
Dang! It smells bad 'round here. Kinda like the time the septic on my mobile backed up.

3840:
I got crotch itch, Woody! We got trouble comin'.

4320:
Keepin' an eye out for an infestation, Woodrow. This place is a prime example of big bug habitat.

4800:
Horsecrap! The dang things are everywhere.

5280:
Look here, Woody.

5760:
Stuff!

6240:
Dang! I'm all out!

6720:
I ain't doing good... Got blood splattering everywhere, Woody. Think I been worse though... Nah, maybe not.

7200:
Len's gone... Dang! Doubt the sun will rise tomorrow.

8160:
They got Scully. Horsecrap! He was special, Woody. Leaves behind eight ex-wives and twenty-one children. Man had no room in his wallet for credit cards. Dang shame!

8640:
Flashed out, Woody. Ya seen what I seen, it would happen to you, too. What's going on?

9120:
Dang! Gotta unjam my piece.

9600:
Once they let up, I'm gonna put 'em away for good.

10080:
Uggh! Hope they got massage parlors down here...

10560:
Dang! They gonna regret not gettin' it right.

11040:
Smell a miss, Woodman. Why bother?

11520:
Need some patch work, Woody. I'm layin' trail.

12000:
Time to turn in, Woody. Be sharper when I wake up.

12480:
Ain't no spring chicken anymore. Gotta recoup.

12960:
Forgotten!

13440:
Beetle juiced!

14880:
What's the deal with the bookworm, Woodman? Flo should be home making pastry - not cowering around my battlefield.

15360:
An old score settled, Woody. Ya know...I had to wait for Mike to leave A.I.M. before they'd take me on. Big shot's been bad mouthing me for years, but it ain't gonna happen no more.

15840:
Somethin' special, huh, Woody. Good gust of wind would have made it spectacular.

16800:
Looking for something to do, Woody.

17280:
Not so inclined.

17760:
Serpent's head, Woodman. The bitch is served.

18240:
That lady bug popped her last egg, Woody.

18720:
What a yo-yo!

19200:
My knees are killin' me, Woody. And you're killin' me, too!

19680:
This country ain't filled with rocket scientists, is it?

20160:
Air strike!

20640:
Dang! Where did ya get this crap, Woodman? A Soviet Union auction?

21120:
Like to work alone, Woody. Ain't got nobody to worry about that way.

21600:
The only thing good about the French is their wine, and I don't drink no more.

22080:
Trial and error, Woodman!

22560:
Get your head out of your ass, Woodpile.

23040:
Don't know what you were thinkin', Woody. Kinda doubt you were thinkin' at all.

24480:
Ya got it, Len! Ain't no doubt about that.

25440:
Scully pulls it out again!

25920:
Let's let it ride, Woody... We'll tackle it later.

26400:
Dang! What luck! I'm begging ya, Woody. Let me be the one to off Mike. Small favor. Won't bug ya for nothing no more.

26880:
Dang! Can't see diddley.

27360:
Gonna die before I ever manage to do this, Woodrow.

27840:
She was kinda nice... Haven't been with a woman in a long time, Woody. Not since the dang implant.

28320:
I'm picking up enemies, Woody.

28800:
They're still here, so don't let nobody get too ballsy, Woody!

29760:
The name's Tarballs. Gus Tarballs!

30240:
It's that punk Joey. Let me shoot him, Woody. Be his mother's last heartache.

30720:
Ya got nuthin' to worry about there, Micheal. Ya got Gus Tarballs down here givin' it his personal attention. That Deidranna she-devil is gonna be leaving Arulco before I do.

31200:
Way to stack 'em up, Woody! We own this real estate now.

31680:
Dang! Looks like someone's been through this! Reminds me of when the twister hit the mobile home park, and stuff got thrown around everywhere. Got me a free toaster and a banged up microwave.

32160:
Only thing that would have made that more satisfying, Woodrow, is gettin' her up so I could do it again. We'll all sleep better tonight.

32640:
Tiger, Woodpile!

33120:
Well, Woodrow, I seen me a lot of action, but nothing quite like this! You keep in touch with old Gus Tarballs, and take care of yourself for gods-sake. I'll miss you, Woody.

33600:
Came to their senses, Woodrow. They done high-tailed it.

34080:
I'm taking a long five, Woody. I gotta get me some dang sleep.

34560:
Tarballs' punchin' in. I'm on the job, Woodman!

35040:
Just what I was thinking.

35520:
Dang, Woodpecker, gotta get this fixed!

36000:
Get a load of this, Woody. Got a live one here!

36480:
Hold your horses. That's got bad news written all over it, Woody.

36960:
Woodrow... get me outta here!... Hey!.. wood pile... pecker... pulp... Woody?.... woodshed?

37440:
I'm where ya wanted me to be, Woody.

38400:
I've run operations myself, ya know, Woody. Know enough about it to know that I don't want no dang part of it.

39360:
Dang! I hate refusing work, but I'm having my knee done.

39840:
Dang, Woody! Why didn't ya ask me earlier? Gotta get home and get my dog to the vet... Gotta put her down. It's got this dang big lump of somethin' growing out its backside.

40320:
I ain't here right now. Dang! I'm hardly ever here. Ain't much of a life, ya know, traveling the world righting wrongs. Anyway... You want to talk to me, you leave me somethin' to track you down.

40800:
I was kinda lookin' to see this baby through until the end, Woody. But you're in charge of the show. Give me a buzz sometime.

42240:
Sorry, Woodman, but I can't be working with Flo the frog. Gotta problem with those people. Been in the business too dang long for that horsecrap.

42720:
Tick...tock, Woody. What's the plan? I'm lookin' to make some.

43200:
I'm sticking with ya, Woodrow.

43680:
Count on me, Woody. As soon as I find my heatin' pad, I'm outta here.

44160:
You got a veteran like Len along for the ride, how can I say no, Woody?

45120:
You're smart enough to sign Scully, you be smart enough for me to sign with you, Woody.

45600:
Nuthin' personal, Woodpile, but I'd sooner date that Bobbit woman.

46080:
Dang! Tune in, Woodrow. I was saying...

46560:
Ya got banking problems, Woody! Yous' N.S.F.! I know, it's those dang service charges. I tell ya what, ya straighten it out, ya get back to me.

47040:
Dang that was quick, Woody. U.S Customs is gonna be all over my luggage. Figure I'm some sorta drug mule or some other horsecrap.

48960:
Sorry, Woodman, but I can't be working with Flo the frog. Gotta problem with those people. Been in the business too dang long for that horsecrap.

49440:
You got a veteran like Len along for the ride, how can I say no, Woody?

50400:
You're smart enough to sign Scully, you be smart enough for me to sign with you, Woody.

50880:
Dang! Tune in, Woodrow. I was saying...

51360:
Ya got banking problems, Woody! Yous' N.S.F.! I know, it's those dang service charges. I tell ya what, ya straighten it out, ya get back to me.

51840:
Tarballs here!

52320:
Ya, I'm with A.I.M. now. At my age, ya gotta start thinking benefits.

52800:
Gotta drain the vein, Woodrow. Can ya step it up?

53280:
What we lookin' at, Woody?

53760:
Get it together Woodchip, ya give me a buzz.

55200:
Well, Woodchip, I'm scheduled to make tracks shortly.

55680:
Now look here, Woodrow. Don't get your wallet in a vice. I'm working my ass off here. It's only fair asking you for a few more dollars.
