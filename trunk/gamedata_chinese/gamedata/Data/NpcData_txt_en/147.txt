Welcome! Best prices in Arulco, guaranteed!

480:
Well, well... Nice to see you again.

960:
You know, if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't. Life just don't make the sense it used to.

1440:
Sometimes, life just sucks, you know that.

1920:
Thanks, but no thanks. You keep it.

2400:
You know, this country's going nuts lately. For Christ's sake, you even got women picking up guns now, and if you ask me, that's just a big, big accident waitin' to happen. No offense.

2880:
Hey, hey, calm down, man! I haven't done anything to you. Enough stress around here already.

3360:
I got drafted back in the eighties. Didn't go then, I ain't planning to go now. It just ain't for me. I'd rather just sit home and have the Mrs. bring me my dinner.

3840:
Man, this hurts like hell.

4320:
Well, you take care. I gotta make myself busy.

4800:
Round here, people generally choose their purchases before they pay for 'em.

5280:
Remember, I got the best prices. Let me know what interests you.

5760:
No rush. Safe in here most of the time.

6240:
Stuff moves pretty quick here. Get it in, and I can usually turn her around in a day or two.

6720:
Looks like you're interested in doing a bit of dealing. That's my game, man.

7200:
I buy stuff all the time, so if you're just looking to sell...

7680:
Sure thing, man. Let me get my manager's cap on.

8160:
Yeah, well uh... I only take stuff I can move, you know?

8640:
I'll be straight with you: I don't think you'll get a dime anywhere.

9120:
You beat this with a heavy stick? Looks rough, man. I can't give you full value for it.

9600:
Yeah, okay. Looks all right. Let me make you a deal here.

10080:
It's not quite enough to cover what you're looking to buy, though.

10560:
Right on. That's that then.

11040:
Let's see, you're covered. Got some change coming, too.

11520:
Well, good doing business with you. Keep me in mind.

12000:
You know where to find me if you get wise.

12480:
Hey, you left some stuff here.

12960:
Sorry, man... Funds are limited. Ain't got any more purchasing power.

13440:
You asked for it man... and here it comes!

13920:
Finish what you started, and then we can talk.

14400:
Look. It's nothing personal, but I gotta make a living. People see me yakking with you, and I'm back hawking porno in San Mona.

14880:
There's a good buzz going around about you guys. People starting to get on your bandwagon. Starting to smell ten years of hell coming to an end.

15360:
Cool. You saved my skin...

15840:
Sorry, man, but I got a life, too. We're closed for the night, so if you want to hurry it along, I'd appreciate it.

16320:
About the only thing you won't find here is guns. Can't keep 'em. Every time I get one to sell, one of them hillbilly Hicks comes down here and steals it. That fraggin' family has been terrorizing Cambria for years.

16800:
Bunch of crazy country cousins, just good for drinking and causing trouble. They live on a farm in the middle of nowhere, just east of here. Bloody tired of 'em, let me tell you.

17280:
About the only thing the people in Cambria fear more than that whacked-out, inbred family is the Army. A catch-22, that leaves those hillbillies free to do whatever they please.

17760:
Shoot 'em myself, but it's one big, happy, shotgun-toting family. And rumor has it that they have enough weapons stashed away to start their own war... Something I wouldn't put past 'em.

18240:
Now, if you were to take a trip over there and talk some sense into them, this town would very much appreciate it. Earn you some points around here for sure.

18720:
As you can see, I'm out of business, man. Fraggin' hillbillies came into town and took everything I had at gunpoint. Loaded my whole fraggin' inventory onto a couple of cows and headed off.

19200:
I got nothing to sell and no money to buy.

19680:
Finally, those Hick boys and their still-brained father have been taken care of. Made yourself a lot of friends around here. Be good for business, too. Thanks, man.
