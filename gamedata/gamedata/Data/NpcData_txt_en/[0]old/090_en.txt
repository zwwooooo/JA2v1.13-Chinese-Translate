480:
Haven't ya got something better to do? Like...isn't there a war going on or something?

960:
She's not my real mother, you know.

1440:
She said it was okay - I swear.

1920:
I don't want nothing from you.

2400:
Ya know, I could show ya around. Introduce you to some of the nicer girls in San Mona.

2880:
Ya sound just like my dad.

3360:
No way. I didn't come up here to get killed, you know. I came up here to get... ah, never mind.

3840:
Uggh... mommy... mommy!

4320:
Just leave me alone.

4800:
I bet ya won't even give me a chance to spend it before you force me to go home.

5280:
Okay, I'll go with you. Just don't let anything happen to me. My mom will be really disappointed if she isn't the one that gets to kill me.

5760:
What ya doing? You can't just leave me here! I'll be good... I swear.

6240:
I hope my dad's not drunk when I get home. He's gonna kill me... Well maybe, if I'm lucky, he won't be there.

6720:
I got lost, Mom... I took a wrong turn, and then I was a little confused as to where I was... and then they found me... I was really lucky, Mom.

7200:
Okay, Mom... Uhh, dad hasn't been drinking, has he?

7680:
I don't want to join you. I don't want to have anything to do with you. I just want to be left alone down here.

8160:
I tell you what... Since I know you're gonna save my skin with my mom, I'll let you in on something... Somebody's stashing cash down here. There's tons of it!

8640:
Sure, I'll take it, but I don't need it. This place is full of money.

9120:
You're crazy!

9600:
No more foolin' around, okay? I'll do exactly what you tell me - I promise!

10080:
Make the shooting stop!
