Enemy in sight.

480:
Well, what do we have here?

960:
This bites, man! Big time!

1440:
It's another one of them skuzzwads.

1920:
Jellydog, that's one ugly son of a bitch.

2400:
Somethin' wicked came this way, man.

2880:
Sounds like somethin's moving.

3360:
<sniff> <sniff> Guess those things never heard of deodorant.

3840:
My stomach's doin' flips.

4320:
I bet those suckers are watchin' us, man.

4800:
These skuzzwads are tryin' to make me the entree!

5280:
Well, lookee here.

5760:
Somethin's over here.

6240:
Out of ammo.

6720:
Oh, man, I'm dead meat.

7200:
Shoot. Outta everyone, I never thought you'd be the one to bite it, Magic. Thought you were invincible, man.

7680:


8160:


8640:
Um...sorry, I'm out of it.

9120:
Oh, perfect time for my gun to jam.

9600:
These suckers are bustin' my chops!

10080:
They're not wastin' me that easily.

10560:
I wasn't worried. Right.

11040:
Like I'm gonna pull that off...

11520:
Oh, man, Blood's bleedin' blood.

12000:
I'm bushed.

12480:
Gotta stop for a moment. I'm not 18 anymore.

12960:
Hah! He's toast!

13440:
One filleted mignon, comin' up!

13920:
That old wino Highball's gettin' on my nerves.

14400:


14880:
Bubba's just a trash-talkin', knuckle-walkin' redneck.

15360:
Aww, Mike wasn't so tough after all! I killed women who went down a lot harder than he did!

15840:
Jellydog, nothin's left of that guy but hamburger.

16320:


16800:
All done here.

17280:
I don't think so.

17760:
No autographs, please. I'm a humble hero!

18240:
All right! I heard they taste like chicken. Now I get to find out!

18720:
Fool's got spam for brains.

19200:
I could be home right now, eatin' take out.

19680:
If I wanted to work with clowns, I woulda joined the circus.

20160:
Blue ice coming down!

20640:
Why doesn't anyone ever check out my gear? It's crap.

21120:


21600:
Don't get me started on South Africans, man. I wanna stay focused on the job here.

22080:
I surprise myself sometimes.

22560:
Even I can see that's a pitiful plan.

23040:
A blind man coulda seen that comin'.

23520:
Hey, you brought on that cracker Cliff, I'm halfway out the door. You know what I'm sayin'? I'll think twice about renewing if working with him's part of the deal.

24000:


24480:
Magic's got it goin' on. You know what I'm sayin'? Class act!

24960:


25440:


25920:
Well, I gotta see how things go awhile yet.

26400:
Oh, man, it's Mike! That dude is like a legend!

26880:
It burns like acid, man. Can't see nothin'.

27360:
This is like going nowhere fast!

27840:
Everybody's got an angle. You know what I'm saying?

28320:
Pickin' up signs of aggressors movin' about.

28800:
We didn't do a clean sweep. Still got a couple of scuzzballs hanging around.

29280:


29760:
Don't mess with me!

30240:
Gotta grab that kid. If it's Joey boy, I think I'm gonna play daddy for a bit.

30720:
We'll take care of business, Miguel. They don't want to be messing with us.

31200:
They're all cooked!

31680:
Hey... It's not all here. Someone want to tell me where the stuff has gone?

32160:
Hey man, she was like a burned piece of chicken. Sometimes you gotta throw food away. You know what I'm saying?

32640:
Skinned cat coming up!

33120:
That's it, man! Like, when I get this feeling right in the gut like a great steak, you know? But this is even better. You keep tight, man. You know where to find me.

33600:
They've gone running back to mama. We're alone for now.

34080:
I gotta crash for a bit. I'll get back on it when I get some sleep.

34560:
Ah, feeling good and moving on.

35040:
Same here!

35520:
It broke! Crappy hand-me-downs...

36000:
Whoa, man. This is trapped!

36480:
Careful. Looks like someone's trying to dice us.

36960:
<glub> Don't let me... go under...

37440:
Order's up, man. I'm here.

37920:


38400:
I know of your command. And I don't need the work that badly.

38880:
No thank you. I'm not goin' home in a baggie.

39360:
Well, see, the annual Texas Chili Cook-off is this weekend, and I don't wanna miss that.

39840:
My old lady wants me to get a vasectomy, and if I skip out on one more appointment, she's gonna do it herself. Gimme some notice next time.

40320:
Hello! Pretty high-tech, eh? This is cool. I'm into this! Leave me a message! And hey...welcome to the 90's!

40800:
Okay by me, I got places to go and things to do. Maybe I'll catch you some other time.

41280:
I ain't working with that Cliff Highball. There's something about drunks and scalpels that just gives me the sweats.

41760:


42240:
Oh, yeah, that Bubba's just achin' to put a bullet in my back while nobody's lookin'. Not me, unh-unh.

42720:
Hey, brother, my contract's almost up. Anything else I can do for you?

43200:
All right, I'm back in the saddle again.

43680:
All right, now you're cookin' with fire.

44160:
Anyone who's got Magic Walker on their team's gotta be doin' something right. You got me, too.

44640:


45120:


45600:
I dunno. I kinda lost my appetite for this whole deal. Later, man.

46080:
Listen, I said...

46560:
Y'see, I gotta get paid, and your portfolio looks a bit thin right now.

47040:
Well, if that's how it's gotta be, then that's how it'll be. Your loss, man. Later.

47520:
No thank you. I'm not goin' home in a baggie.

48000:
I ain't working with that Cliff Highball. There's something about drunks and scalpels that just gives me the sweats.

48480:


48960:
Oh, yeah, that Bubba's just achin' to put a bullet in my back while nobody's lookin'. Not me, unh-unh.

49440:
Anyone who's got Magic Walker on their team's gotta be doin' something right. You got me, too.

49920:


50400:


50880:
Listen, I said...

51360:
Y'see, I gotta get paid, and your portfolio looks a bit thin right now.

51840:
Yeah, Blood here, wussup?

52320:
I'm heavy into martial arts, man...tae kwon do, ju jitsu, karate, judo, you name it. I'm into enough stuff that they didn't have room for it on my resume.

52800:
Pick it up, man.

53280:
How long are you planning to keep me on?

53760:
Let me know when you got it goin' on. I might be around.

54240:


54720:


55200:
Sorry to say it, man, but my time here's almost up.

55680:
I'm worth a bit more now. Know what I'm saying?
