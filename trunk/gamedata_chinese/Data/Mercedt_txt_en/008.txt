0:
More evil peoples.

480:
I spy the evil peoples.

960:
Goddamn it to hell!

1440:
Ooh, monster!

1920:
Jesus and Mary. I would not have thought such monsters existed.

2400:
A monster was here.

2880:
I hear noise close by.

3360:
Ouwah, the stench of the monsters revolts me.

3840:
The hairs on the back of my neck are, umm, upstanding.

4320:
I pray the monsters are not here.

4800:
Monsters to the right! Monsters to the left! Goddamn!

5280:
What is that?

5760:
There's something there.

6240:
Gun is empty, dammit to hell!

6720:
My life is, uhh, flushing before my eyes.

8160:
This man Grizzly was larger than life to me. God save his soul. God save all our souls. Amen.

8640:
I forget...what am I thinking? Damn, damn, DAMN!

9120:
Gun is jamming up on me. Oohw!

9600:
Stupid fools push me too far!

10080:
They hardly lay hand on me... Oh, tooth come out.

10560:
That make my blood sing...

11040:
If I miss, it is okay?

11520:
My skin is punctured and leaking.

12000:
Need sleep to keep up strength.

12480:
I have no breath. It will pass.

12960:
Another falls before me.

13440:
The monsters are not so tough.

13920:
Something stinks. Maybe is Ivan? All his people have stench of tyranny.

14400:
If you find me dead with a knife in my back, I tell you now it is Igor. He is treacherous.

15360:
Mike thought he be immortal. He did not figure on meeting a Gontarski.

15840:
Repulsive. But no pain, I guess.

16800:
My assignment has come finished. What to do now?

17280:
Find someone else to do that.

17760:
Ah, she was only a woman. Naturally I am superior.

18240:
I assume I get big bonus for this.

18720:
That is not mercenary, that is dirt beneath my feet.

19200:
The way this outfit is run, I do not like.

19680:
They make bad team. Bad decisions. It should be me in charge.

20160:
Trouble in the sky!

20640:
There is limit to what I can do with these goddamn cheap supplies.

21120:
When in doubt, think, "What would Gontarski do here?"

21600:
I think of Russia like my mother, both could die I would not care.

22080:
At this rate, I soon be perfect.

22560:
This is not idea, this is fantasy.

23040:
As you say... "Back to drawing board," eh?

23520:
You want Ivan on your team? Then you DON'T want ME. I would stay behind if I had known you would let him to join.

24000:
I do not work with Communist like Igor. I stick to contract, but after that, if Igor still here, I make thought to leave.

25440:
Hehehehe... Grizzly is not bad, eh? I knew this.

25920:
No no no, not yet. Have to work out together more, yes?

26400:
Hey hey! Mike's here! Hahaha, now we see who is better man!

26880:
Dammit to Hell! I do not see what is going on.

27360:
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! This is not possible!

27840:
Now... this guy I like. He good guy.

28320:
Peoples of evil be here!

28800:
We must not forget that we have left our enemies hiding.

29280:
Grandma Gontarski blesses me from above with great riches.

30240:
Look! It is that wild kid we are looking here and there for.

30720:
Miguel, I am "the man." These are other people. I will make her surrender to me in many ways.

31200:
Ha ha ha! All evil has been lifted and separated.

31680:
Dammit to hell! I do not see everthing here.

32160:
She was bad woman, and she die for the good of all people here.

32640:
Oh Mary!!

33120:
We did all of them good! Finished and evil is dead! Goddamn! This mean more money for me, yes?

33600:
Evil people cower like children in retreat. They catch wind of Gontarski, no doubt.

34080:
My lids close. I will sleep for you and be better.

34560:
I have arisen. Amen.

35040:
Me too, yes?

35520:
Dammit to hell! This is broken junk!

36000:
Stop! A large boob trap is present.

36480:
Slow! There is danger on ground there.

36960:
Grandma... I am... engulfed by the seas...

37440:
I took my hike. What now?

38400:
I apologize. Your reputation makes me, umm, discomfortable.

38880:
I am not a person with, umm, death wish. Perhaps you can improve, yes? Telephone me when better.

39360:
I going to Chicago. Is Pulaski Day celebration. I see you other time.

39840:
Uhh, Pope is making first visit to hometown. You let me know more time ahead next time, eh?

40320:
Robert Gontarski is, umm, unavoidable right now. Tell me who you are and what you want, and maybe I put him in touch with you, maybe not.

40800:
I thank you for, umm, giving me the business. I see you.

41280:
I don't work with Ivan. His people...hmm, I have nothing good to say.

41760:
No, no, no, you have Igor Dolvich on team. I sooner work with Germans.

42720:
My contract is, umm, up yours for renewal if you like job I do for you.

43200:
Very good! I am yours again.

43680:
It is an agreement!

45120:
The arrangement is not ideal. But I like to work beside Mr. Bornell. All right.

45600:
I am tired of your ways of working. I look elsewhere now.

46080:
I say again...

46560:
Without the, mmm, money to pay, I don't work.

47040:
You dismiss me quickly, but you too will see. It is mistake.

47520:
I am not a person with, umm, death wish. Perhaps you can improve, yes? Telephone me when better.

48000:
I don't work with Ivan. His people...hmm, I have nothing good to say.

48480:
No, no, no, you have Igor Dolvich on team. I sooner work with Germans.

50400:
The arrangement is not ideal. But I like to work beside Mr. Bornell. All right.

50880:
I say again...

51360:
Without the, umm, money to pay, I don't work.

51840:
This is Steroid Gontarski speaking.

52320:
If I work with your team, I whip other members into shape damn quick.

52800:
What you waiting for me to say?

53280:
How long you want me?

53760:
You decide if you want me to work, then you call.

54240:
I need job, so I say yes. But you must understand that I not like Ivan Dolvich. Please keep many trees between us.

54720:
To be forced to work with Igor Dolvich is to me displeasing. Please make him sit in corner by himself, not by me.

55200:
My contract is almost at, hmm, finish line.

55680:
I have been pushed from bottom up, and so now raise my rate of benefits.
