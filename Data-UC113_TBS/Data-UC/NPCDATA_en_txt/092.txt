Frank's the name, booze is my game.

480:
Welcome to the best bar in town.

960:
Are you guys here to clean up Crepaton and the rest of Brenda's goons? I wish you luck.

1440:
If you need the latest information about who runs what in Danubia, buy a drink, have a seat and take notes.

1920:
Money I can always use, but that... errrr, no thanks.

2400:
Frank, best barman in town at your service. What's your poison?

2880:
Hey man, I talk and serve booze. If you're desperate for action, say that to a policeman.

3360:
Errr... no thanks. I sorta need to be close to alcohol... Lots of it every day!

3840:
Holey moley, I just got ventilated by a stray slug... Call an ambulance... aaaargh!

4320:
Glad to be of help. Try some other bars in town for more info. Rumor is the De Santos boys are pretty chummy with our rebel friends. See you again soon I hope.

4800:
Thanks!

Duck, you dummy! There's a battle going on!

14880:
General Marco is head of Danubia's armed forces, one mean SOB. Probably find him at a base or on one of his inspection tours. Don't go pointing anything at soldiers if you're smart.

15360:
Looking for the world's most corrupt cop? Look no further than our own chief of police, Commissioner Dragomir Woltz. He travels around a lot. Might bump into him on the road, or Police headquarters in the capital.

15840:
If it's Crepaton execs you're after, Claudia Papanus is head of Marketing. Uses a stretched black limo with a security detail protecting her.

16320:
Same for their director of research, Ernest Bacardi. Commutes regularly between Crepaton plants, research centres and their headquarters in Adrian.

16800:
Do everyone in Danubia a favor, and exterminate Bruno Stolitz who runs Satan's Sons. They are the scumbags causing chaos in the subways.

17280:
You might find some of 'em on the road riding motorbikes as well. Set 'em on fire after shooting off their kneecaps for me, will ya?

17760:
If you want weapons, try the gunrunners. Heard a guy called Tony in Port Kip sells their stuff over the counter.

18240:
Real boss is Walter Smirnoff. They have 5 depots in quiet, rural areas, smuggling stuff mainly by paying off corrupt customs officials at airports.
