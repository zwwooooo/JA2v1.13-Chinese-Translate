Another lamb.

480:
Okay, let's paint the town red... with the enemy's blood!

960:
I got a foot in the grave here!

1440:
Mudpuppy from hell!

1920:
Izzat what all the fuss is about? An overgrown mudpuppy? I'll split 'em from head to toe and feed their guts to my rotweilers.

2400:
Looks like the mudpuppies had a picnic.

2880:
Who the hell made that noise?

3360:
<sniff> Smells like we're crawlin' up a mudpuppy's ass.

3840:
I gotta feelin' we're about to step into somethin' high, wide and deep. I've never felt better!

4320:
Mudpuppy alert. Not sure why, I just know they're comin'.

4800:
You motherlovin' mudpuppies. I'll see you in hell!

5280:
Got something here.

5760:
What the hell is that?

6240:
Goddamn gun is outta goddamn ammo.

6720:
Damn... I'm worm food.

8160:
Oh, Stephen, tough tarts, man. You weren't bad, as far as men go. Adios, amigo.

8640:
What the hell's wrong with me? I forgot what I was doin'.

9120:
Goddamn it, now my motherlovin' gun is jammed!

9600:
If these assholes take me down, I'm takin' them all with me!

10080:
I got worse than that from my old man when I was three. Gave it back to him good, too.

10560:
Now I'm pissed.

11040:
Do I look like a magician? Forget it.

11520:
Hey, I burst a blood vessel over here.

12000:
I've gotta sleep. No shit.

12480:
I'm outta breath.

12960:
Eighty-sixed.

13440:
Play dead, mudpuppy!

13920:
How does that chickenshit Biff rate this team, anyway?

14880:
Flo ain't fit to wipe my ass.

15360:
When Mike saw who he was facin', he knew the end was coming. I could see it in his eyes.

15840:
Wouldja look at that? Hey, when do we eat?

16800:
All done.

17280:
Bite me. Get someone else to do it.

17760:
Yeah, baby! She went down smooth 'n easy... speaking of which, I could use a shot of whiskey.

18240:
That's it? C'mon, you pussy, get up and fight! I was just warming up! HAHAHAHA!

18720:
What a pablum-puking buttwipe.

19200:
I've just about had it with this candyass operation.

19680:
I'm livin' with dorks, dinks, and twerps. What're ya gonna do?

20160:
They're bringin' in their goddamn bombers!

20640:
Crappy guns, crappy ammo, crappy armor... I got nothing to work with here.

21120:
I love my work! Killing can be a lot of fun, when you have the right attitude.

21600:
Too many men in this line of work. They're great for the grunt stuff, but they just don't have the stomach for the rough stuff.

22080:
Effin' A'!

22560:
That ain't gonna work! How dumb do I look?

23040:
What the hell else was expected?

23520:
With that suckass Biff around, we might as well pack it up and go home. If I'd known you were gonna let him in, I wouldn't have signed that contract.

25440:
Stephen is prime meat.

25920:
Not so fast, buster. Let's see how it goes for a while.

26400:
It's Mikey-boy! This's gonna be a trip!

26880:
As soon as I can see it again, I'm gonna kill it!

27360:
Give me a break! It's pointless!

27840:
One of the few that don't turn my stomach.

28320:
We got hostiles in the vicinity. Not to worry... when I see 'em, I'll kill 'em.

28800:
Haven't killed them all yet.

29760:
Moments like that make everything worthwhile!

30240:
If that's Joey Graham, the runaway, I say we just shoot him. We can tell his mother it was accident.

30720:
Well, Miguel, you're obviously serious. You're sending in the best. I like that in a man. Not much else, but I like that.

31200:
Goddamn! They're all dead! I'll have to deal with the disappointment.

31680:
It's not all here. Someone better fess up to this now, or I'm going to start shooting at random until someone does.

32160:
Some people just beg ya to do it.

32640:
Now there's a pet for me.

33120:
So, I hope you all learned something from this. You can fix anything with a gun. The bigger the gun, the faster things get resolved. You'd think they teach that at school. Oh, yeah, good work everyone.

33600:
They backed out. Obviously they knew what they were up against. Pussies.

34080:
I'm crashin'. I'll let ya know when I'm up.

34560:
Goddamn, I hate getting up. I'm back on the job!

35040:
Yeah, well hang on, pussy. I got the same situation here.

35520:
Gotta get this motherloving goddamn thing fixed.

36000:
There's a trap here, and I ain't biting.

36480:
Huh? Motherloving, son-of-a... not gonna fool me. That doesn't look right.

36960:
I ain't never been wet, and I don't intend to start now. Need to get my ass outta this water!

37440:
I'm here. What the hell am I supposed to do now?

38400:
I've seen your results, little boy. You can't give me what I need. You can't even keep up with me. Hire one of the wimps instead. They're more your speed.

38880:
No way, Jose. I know your death rate. I think you're in cahoots with the enemy.

39360:
Sorry, it's my weekend to take the kids. I miss this one and my goddamned ex'll get all my visitation rights yanked. Blows, doesn't it?

39840:
No dice, I'm moving. Man, you gotta let me know ahead of time.

40320:
Meltdown. If this is something I want to hear, leave me a message. Otherwise, hang up now. Fair warning.

40800:
It's your call. We're square. See ya.

41280:
Guess again, bozo. I don't work with little Biffy. He's a scared little boy who oughta be home takin' care of his mama.

42240:
Not a chance in hell. What do you need me for? You've got that trembling little bowl of jelly, Flo. I'm sure she'll be a huge help. If you want me, dump her.

42720:
My contract's almost over. You up for more, or have I scared you off yet?

43200:
Good enough. I'll stick.

43680:
All right. Deal.

45120:
Well... I don't know. I guess, since you've got Stephen on the team. He's kind of a prig, y'know, but he's cute enough. All right, could be a kick.

45600:
Renew with YOU? HAH! Do I look like a goddamned masochist?

46080:
Hey, numbnuts. I said...

46560:
I don't take checks, I don't take credit cards, and you don't have the cash. Where do think that leaves us?

47040:
Screw it. I don't need you. YOU need ME. You just ain't figured it out yet. You'll come crawlin' back and then we'll see what's what.

47520:
No way, Jose. I know your death rate. I think you're in cahoots with the enemy.

48000:
Guess again, bozo. I don't work with little Biffy. He's a scared little boy who oughta be home takin' care of his mama.

48960:
Not a chance in hell. What do you need me for? You've got that trembling little bowl of jelly, Flo. I'm sure she'll be a huge help. If you want me, dump her.

50400:
Well... I don't know. I guess, since you've got Stephen on the team. He's kind of a prig, y'know, but he's cute enough. All right, could be a kick.

50880:
Hey, numbnuts. I said...

51360:
I don't take checks, I don't take credit cards, and you don't have the cash. Where do you think that leaves us?

51840:
Yeah, Meltdown. This about a job?

52320:
I still have a photo of the first person I ever killed.

52800:
Gee, another heavy breather. You guys are so twisted.

53280:
So what kind of deal you looking for?

53760:
Don't call me if all you're gonna do is leer at me. Or, I'll find out where you live, and I'll kill ya.

55200:
Hey Attention Span, my contract turns sour soon. Just thought you might like to know the amount of time we can enjoy each other's company is limited.

55680:
Effin' A'! I'm feeling good! About time I get a raise! Cough it up there Bunny Balls. You know I'm worth it. And I know where you live.
