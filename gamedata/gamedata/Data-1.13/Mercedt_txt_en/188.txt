I spotted an enemy!

480:
I've stumbled upon an enemy!

960:
What am I doing here?!

1440:
Holy moly!

1920:
I'm risking my life for this?!

2400:
It's horrible. They never showed anything like this in the recruitment films.

2880:
I have to stay on red alert until I'm advised differently.

3360:
I'm disoriented.

3840:
I can spot danger when I see it - and there's danger around here!

4320:
Maybe, umm, I could come back later?

4800:
I gotta get out of here!

5280:
Look what I found!

5760:
What luck!

6240:
I don't have any bullets!

6720:
Why I'm here in the pool of blood, dying? I'm gonna die on one of my first assignments...

7200:
Biff? Biff! Come in, Biff! He's dead? Who's gonna show me the ropes? And who's gonna play checkers with me?

8640:
I sort of lost it there for a moment.

9120:
Oh my god. My gun won't fire!

9600:
There's bullets flying everywhere!

10080:
I think I could use a lot more of practice.

10560:
Lucky me!

11040:
I don't think I can do it!

11520:
Yes. I'm definitely bleeding over here!

12000:
I can't do it...

12480:
God! Am I thirsty...

12960:
Oh, neat! This is really exciting!

13440:
Oh, neat! This is really exciting!

15360:
Na na na-na na!

15840:
This combat stuff is pretty scary.

16800:
Everything turned out alright!

17280:
I don't know...

17760:
It's sure feels good to get that first one under your belt.

18240:
That seemed to go really well.

18720:
I still deserve a little respect!

19200:
You're hopeless and haven't got a shot at winning anything!

19680:
I can't afford to be too demanding.

20160:
Holy moly!

20640:
I don't know what's wrong with it, but I can't get it to work.

21120:
I don't mean to brag, but me and five hundred other guys secured the whole school in Grenada. And it was night time!

21600:
The National Guard wants me to stay available for possible emergency deployment!

22080:
It's all there. I know on paper there seems to be better guys out there, but how many of them have the experience of the full-scale military operation?

22560:
Maybe no one will notice...

23040:
In the future - you should really consider sending the bodies home.

24480:
Biff's the only mercenary who'll talk to me!

25920:
I don't know how to bring this up but you still owe me money.

26400:
I'll call the whole thing off, if you promise not to hurt me!

26880:
God!

27360:
I don't think I can do it!

27840:
That's an unauthorized fraternization, and if you do it again - I won't report you.

28320:
Let's be really carefull. We don't want anything to go wrong now!

28800:
Wouldn't it be great, if everything just stayed like this?

29760:
This just keeps getting more and more exciting, doesn't it?

30240:
Let's head back now.

30720:
Please. Give me another chance. I can do better. I promise!

31200:
I can't tell how happy I am to be finally rid of those guys.

31680:
We were really overcharged!

32160:
You have to promise me, no one will ever find out about this.

32640:
Holy moly!

33120:
Grenada was hell compared to this!

33600:
The recruiter never told me it would be this easy!

34080:
It's getting late.

34560:
I volunteer.

35040:
I remember telling you.

35520:
I don't know what's wrong with it, but I can't get it to work.

36000:
We should get someone down here, who's familiar with booby traps.

36480:
I can't be sure about this, but there's something really weird about these patterns in the dirt.

36960:
Help me, I can't swim any longer!

37440:
Everything seems quiet.
