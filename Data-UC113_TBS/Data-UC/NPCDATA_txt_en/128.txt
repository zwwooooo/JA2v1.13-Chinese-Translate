Vlad Dracul, director of Danubia Blood Bank, at your service. Welcome. How may I help you?

480:
Mmmmm... Who is that lovely lady with your group? Could she be persuaded to make a donation? Oh yes, I could put the bite on her with enthusiasm!

960:
Did you know registered donors receive a twenty per cent discount at Dr. Mortimer's Crematorium and Memorial Gardens Cemetery?

1440:
In your line of work, I imagine you often consider the eventuality of passing into the next world.

1920:
Blood I can always use, but that, superfluous to my needs. Thank you, no.

2400:
Dr. Mortimer can facilitate all arrangements for you to go in style, a lovely man. He even has a service where your ashes are mailed to any nominated address, included in the package deal.

2880:
Not a wise decision, to make threats against me!

3360:
Oh, dear no. I have a medical condition which makes it necessary to avoid sunlight. Would be awkward in your line of work.

3840:
I'm losing blood. Nurse, nurse! I need a transfusion immediately!

4320:
It has been a pleasure, but you must pardon me, there are urgent duties requiring my attention. All these dreadful motor accidents and the war, the demand for blood is higher than ever.

4800:
All that spilt blood, a shocking waste!
