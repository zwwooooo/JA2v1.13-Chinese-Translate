What can I do for you?

480:
It is hopeful, yes?

960:
We are grateful for your presence.

1440:
I hope we'll be all right.

1920:
No, I do not want this.

2400:
There is no one more evil than Deidranna.

2880:
There is no need for anger. We fight for the same cause.

3360:
The time is not right. I am needed in Omerta.

3840:
Wounded. I will die for sure.

4320:
I have to go now.

4800:
Do not move and no one will die.

5280:
Enrico? Chivaldori? Most suspicious. I question his reasons.

5760:
I am impressed with your leadership. I will join because it is best for Arulco.

6240:
An act of aggression against one of us is an act of aggression against all of us. Your fate is decided!

6720:
We are short of food, too, Miguel. We need safe passage to Drassen or more people will die.

7200:
It will aid our efforts. Thank you.

7680:
Are you sure this is wise, Miguel?

8160:
This situation has grown desperate. Omerta remains without supplies for its people. When will this change?

8640:
Our people are suffering in hunger. You must do something. It cannot continue without the loss of more life.

9120:
You have made progress, but we must exercise caution. We have not heard the last from Deidranna.

9600:
I see hope in the eyes of the people, a hope I have not seen in a long time. But I shall deny myself this feeling until victory is within our hands.

10080:
Almost half the country is ours, but we still have much work to do.
