Watch out! A bad person!

480:
This stranger does not see me.

960:
There's baddies!

1440:
It is unbelievable.

1920:
I really don't wanna touch you.

2400:
Everyone makes mistakes.

2880:
Something really weird is going on!

3360:
Something really weird is going on!

3840:
I'm gonna look for a safer place.

4320:
Oh, don't believe everything you read in the newspaper.

4800:
Staying alive is awfully hard around here!

5280:
I see something.

5760:
I see something.

6240:
More bullets, please!

6720:
Say... goodbye to all the kids for me... I'm not gonna make it.

8640:
I'm lost without instructions.

9120:
My gun won't fire!

9600:
I don't want to become... extinct.

10080:
I've been bopped.

10560:
Somebody's trying to hurt me!

11040:
I don't think I can make it.

11520:
I've been hurt!

12000:
I'm really pooped...

12480:
That hurts.

12960:
Sorry...

13440:
Sorry...

15360:
No more mister nice Dyno for you!

15840:
Oh no! Not again!

16320:
I'm having a bad day.

16800:
We're all tied up, boys and girls! We're gonna have to do it again.

17280:
I'm stopping this, before I lose more self-esteem.

17760:
You deserve to be punished!

18240:
It was alright! But I still want my old job back.

18720:
I should stick up for myself more often.

19200:
Maybe I can find a job as a team mascot...

19680:
I hear the Pirates are looking for a new mascot.

20160:
I'm gonna look for a safer place.

20640:
I think it's broken.

21120:
I can't believe those idiots replaced me with a woman! Those kids were lying. Kids do lie, you know. Especially that short, little, fat kid.

21600:
Those idiot producers are going to change their mind, and hire me back! I just know it! My replacement won't be able to have the job.

22080:
I'd say my greatest asset is my trustworthiness... I hope that's helpful.

22560:
I'm too scared to get fired again.

23040:
We'll never be able to do the job now.

25920:
You need help with your counting! You do not have enough money.

26400:
You're a one bad apple!

26880:
That hurts.

27360:
I thought I could make it.

27840:
I'll have to get back in touch with you.

28320:
Be alert! Remember the rules of safety, when walking through this area.

28800:
This is fun! I just love hide-and-go-seek!

29760:
Bigger numbers!

30240:
I think you should go stand in the corner, young man.

30720:
Well, ok. I have to expect getting fired sooner or later.

31200:
Wow! That wasn't too bad.

31680:
I think he made a lot of money of us.

32160:
A woman! I was replaced by a woman, wasn't I?

32640:
Here goes!

33120:
It is unbelievable! I went from nothing to all these people looking to hire me. Well, you have to know it's gonna cost you more.

33600:
If it was always as peaceful as this - I wouldn't mind this job.

35040:
For sure.

35520:
I think it's broken.

36000:
We should be real careful getting this, we don't want anything to go wrong.

36480:
Remember the rules of safety.

36960:
I'm drowning!

37440:
I'm lost without instructions.
