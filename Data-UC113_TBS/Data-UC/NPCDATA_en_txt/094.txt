Welcome to the bar. My name is Peter, bartender to the stars, the rich and the famous.

480:
Information is available, in addition to the best drinks in town.

960:
Welcome friends, please be seated. What can I serve you?

1440:
I understand you are interested in finding Satan's Sons. Perhaps I can help. A friend of the rebels has confirmed you are trustworthy.

1920:
Thank you, your generosity is welcome, but I have that already.

2400:
If you are interested in finding Bruno Stolitz, the leader of Satan's Sons, that's easy. He has a hideout in the abandoned part of Drake subway.

2880:
That's no way to treat someone who is helping you!

3360:
My life is exciting enough here. Evicting drunks is about the most action I'm interested in. Sorry, I must decline your offer.

3840:
Aarrrrggghh, call a doctor! This isn't a spilt bloody mary!

4320:
Goodbye, my friend. The country will be grateful after Satan's Sons have been exterminated. Do it slowly and painfully, if possible.

5280:
What can I serve you?

6240:
I understand you are interested in the best drinks in town.

6720:
 

7200:
 

7680:
I see...

11520:
Goodbye my friends. I am grateful.

12480:
Take that!

14400:
Man, I'm too busy kissing the floor and ducking bullets to talk now.

14880:
You will find several bars around the country frequented by Satan's Sons. They are mainly involved in subway crime, extortion and drug dealing.

15360:
Frankly, everyone in Danubia wants to see Satan's Sons dead, including the police, so if you perform this good deed everyone will look the other way.

15840:
A vicious mugger called Bruiser Brutal who robs people on trains and subways is Bruno's right hand man. The transit police have been here asking about him recently.
