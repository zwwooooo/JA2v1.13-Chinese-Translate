98560:
Yours Truly, ¡À Enrico Chivaldori ¡À

Keep up the Good Work

99840:
Your message was most encouraging. I am finally beginning to accept that this cause is not hopeless. Do not misinterpret what I mean. I have always believed in you, otherwise I would not given you everything I owned. However, after all these years, it is hard to believe that Arulco may be freed. ¡À

The Final Push

I could not have received better news. I urge you to push forward and resist the temptation to celebrate prematurely. Until Deidranna is removed from power, no man can rest. ¡À

Yours Truly, ¡À Enrico Chivaldori ¡À

103040:
RE: Setback

103680:
I trust you will recover from this setback. The news, though distressing, I hope will only serve to strengthen your resolve. Deidranna is a formidable opponent, of that, I am well-aware. Do not despair. ¡À

104320:
Yours Truly, ¡À Enrico Chivaldori ¡À

104960:
Bad News

105600:
Do not allow your confidence to waiver. The situation is temporary. It was only a matter of time before Deidranna's forces made the necessary adjustments. ¡À ¡À I have faith in you and your team. ¡À

106240:
Yours Truly, ¡À Enrico Chivaldori ¡À

106880:
Most Troubling

107520:
I must say, it is hard to believe such a beast exists. However, if they do, I have no doubt that Deidranna is somehow behind them. I trust our arrangement includes their removal from the country as well. ¡À

108160:
I wish you luck locating the source of these beasts. ¡À ¡À Yours Truly, ¡À Enrico Chivaldori ¡À
