I'm Doreen Harrows, the factory manager.

480:
What do you want this time?

960:
This isn't going anywhere.

1440:
You are only wasting time. Mine included.

1920:
I don't want any of your gifts.

2400:
You should just go back to wherever you came from.

2880:
Okay... I'd like to help you, but I only know about making baseball caps and sweatshirts.

3360:
I care nothing about you, or this country.

3840:
Ohhh...the pain. The pain is unbearable!

4320:
I really don't have time for this.

4800:
I hope you're not expecting me to do anything for it... because I won't.

5280:
This is a private company, you have no business being here. You'll find nothing that concerns you, or your war. We make baseball caps and sweatshirts for a celebrity-endorsed clothing line.

5760:
I understand your concern about the age of the workers. I, too, was fooled the first time I saw them. They are all a lot older than they look.

6240:
It's the exceptional working conditions. Keeps them looking youthful.

6720:
They should be in school? They are in school... This is the school.

7200:
Look! I've had enough of this. I have a business to run. And I'll run it any damn way I choose. You don't like it, too bad.

7680:
You're right! You are absolutely right... They're kids. I'll shut the factory down. I never liked this job anyway.

8160:
Mary Lynn will have to get her clothing line manufactured somewhere else. I never liked that woman either. Thought she was really something cause she had her own TV show.

8640:
I've seen the light. I don't know what I was thinking before, but you straightened me out, and I'm grateful for it.

9120:
You idiot!

9600:
Get away from me. I don't want your help.

10080:
The Queen will deal with you soon enough. Her word will be final, so enjoy life while you can.

10560:
Not now... You're a walking target, in case you hadn't noticed.
