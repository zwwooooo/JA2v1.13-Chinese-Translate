I got a live one, son!

480:
I'd like to shoot, son, before I'm noticed here.

960:
I'm knee deep in combat, son.

1440:
I got a live one, son!

1920:
I gotta consider retirement.

2400:
I'm tired of this, son!

2880:
You hard of hearing, sonny?

3360:
I've been in this business a long time, son. I smell something in the wind.

3840:
Awful quiet. I haven't see any of them yellow bellies in a while, son.

4320:
I'm too old for this!

4800:
I'm knee deep in trouble here, son.

5280:
Son... there's something over here.

5760:
Guess they needed the old guy to come down here and find it.

6240:
Son, I've ran out of firepower!

6720:
Son... I'm bleeding real good! <cough> This could be the end of long and illustrious career...

7200:
They killed Fox! Nobody ever filled the uniform like she did... Oh, and nobody ever will.

8640:
Sorry to bother you, son, but... I can't remember for the life of me where I'm supposed to go!

9120:
I need cover fire, my gun's buggered!

9600:
Oh, you got me riled, son!

10080:
Keep this up, and I'm gonna need a stretcher. 

10560:
Luck is how I managed to get old, son.

11040:
It don't look feasible, son.

11520:
Ah... I think they hit an artery, son.

12000:
Keep this up, and I'm gonna need a stretcher.

12480:
Oh, my legs are wiped.

12960:
Another one bites the dust, son!

13440:
Another one bites the dust, son!

14880:
Bring home the bacon, son!

15360:
You was close, sonny. But close is only good enough when you dealin' with hand grenades!

15840:
Goodbye!

16800:
I'm just thankful that at my age someone can still find use for me.

17280:
I have to tell ya - in all my years in the business, I ain't never been asked to do this before!

17760:
I couldn't have picked a better way to end my career!

18240:
We're bringing home the bacon, son!

18720:
In my younger years I'd bop you in the head, son!

19200:
I was fifth up the beach at Normandy... I don't think we lost half the men you have.

19680:
Not since Patton forgot where he parked his tank, have I seen such a lack of memory in the leader of warriors.

20160:
I'm too old for this!

20640:
I can't use this, it ain't working!

21120:
Eh, don't be fooled son, I still got a good couple of missions in me!

21600:
This operation is strictly junior league!

22080:
Eh, don't be fooled son, I still got a good couple of missions in me!

22560:
You're brave, son! You- you're just not very bright!

23040:
Son, have you read any of the books? Cause if you know the least little bit about what you've been doing, maybe you wouldn't be doing it!

24480:
You got that young babe, Cynthia Guzzman, on your team, right? Ho-ho! She's a babe! And I think she's taking a liking to me...

25920:
Son, this ain't the world of high finance. You have to pay your bills when they're due. When you understand that - you look me up.

26400:
I can take him off, if you want.

26880:
I don't believe this!

27360:
Son, this isn't really my field. And to be honest, even if it was, my hands seem to have the mind of their own lately.

27840:
Now, it's good to see somebody still respects their elders.

28320:
Ready, willing - and almost able.

28800:
We're not through, son! We're just sitting' and waitin' for ya!

29760:
Everybody knows who the best is now, son!

30240:
Oh, he's a sly one, son. We gotta watch him real close.

30720:
You don't need me anymore, son - you need a lucky charm!

31200:
We flushed out that outfit, son!

31680:
I don't wanna get into what happened to Lee, when he tried to stiff me at Gettysburg!

32160:
I'm from the old school, son. I'm not keen on killing women.

32640:
I got a live one, son!

33120:
I gotta say, I'm really satisfied with the way it went, son.

33600:
Look on the bright side, son! If you live through the day, you'll be a better person for it!

34080:
Son, you're gonna have to cut the old guy some slack.

34560:
Lookin' like it's gonna be a great day for some combat, son.

35040:
I already told you.

35520:
I can't use this, it ain't working!

36000:
I think it's set to blow up!

36480:
I've been in this business long enough to know when the ground's been tampered with. Son, this place is wired.

36960:
Son! There was a time, when I would've done a butterfly for twice the distance, and I'm too tired now. I don't think I can make it!

37440:
All clear, son!
