I'm Doctor Willis. Can I help ya?

480:
What seems to be the problem this time?

960:
Between you and me, this war has been necessary for a long time. I wish you the best of luck.

1440:
I cannot tell ya how many times I've thought of retiring to a quiet family practice in some other country.

1920:
I appreciate it, but I cannot accept it.

2400:
The sooner this conflict is over the better.

2880:
We're in a hospital. There's no need to raise your voice. I have already decided to offer my full cooperation.

3360:
I've taken quite the risk to offer you treatment. It's as involved as I care to be.

3840:
I cannot treat my injuries... I need assistance.

4320:
I'm sorry, but I have patients to attend to.

4800:
Thank you.

5280:
I'm sure we can handle another patient.

5760:
You're going to be keeping me busy for a while. I hope things are going better for you than they appear to be.

6240:
I'll attend to it, though I will have to charge you for my services. The money will allow me to give the people around here the medical attention they need.

6720:
Seeing how you're fighting for the betterment of Arulco, I'll give you a bit of a break on the price.

7200:
I wanted to let you know that we all appreciate what you're doing. And just to show you what I mean, I'm only asking you to cover the cost of the treatment.

7680:
We've all decided to waive any fees for our services. This treatment is on the hospital.

8160:
Of course, as distasteful as it is, there will be a charge for the treatment.

8640:
Seeing how you've helped the Grahams with their son, there'll be no charge for this treatment, and I'll keep my fees to a minimum from here on in.

9120:
Very well... I'll be right there.

9600:
Very well, then... leave everything to me, and I'll get things fixed up right.

10080:
Okay, leave them with me. I'll get them all back on their feet before you know it.

10560:
Well... If you change your mind or things take a turn for the worst, you know where to find me.

11040:
Once you get the fighting under control, maybe then, we can talk.

11520:
I just hope I don't run out of medical supplies. It seems someone's been stealing from us. They're probably selling it on the black market.

12000:
I'm terribly sorry, but I don't have the necessary supplies to heal anyone. We were cleaned out. Hopefully, we'll get a shipment in the next couple of days.

12480:
I can't take medical supplies or medicine from you. You'll have to clear it with administration.

12960:
You are demented!

13440:
It is too dangerous right now to help you. We are being watched.

13920:
I have to tell you, I had my doubts when you first got here. But you've proven that you're out to win this war, and the town of Cambria stands solidly behind you.

14400:
Just thought I'd mention that I realize you're mercenaries and you're in this for money, but we need you. We need you to stay with it. You're the last hope for this country.

14880:
Thanks. Feels a little strange to be on the receiving end.

15360:
Of course, you'll have to pay for the treatment, now, in cash.

15840:
I'll need all of it.
