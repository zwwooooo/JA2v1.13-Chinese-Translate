960:
Hell's bells!

1440:
A ratbag over there!

1920:
Holy-dooly! I never seen one of them before.

2400:
Ewwwh. Some bloke was in a barney 'ere.

2880:
Hope my ears are playin' tricks on me.

3360:
(sniff) Something's been rolling around in, something.

3840:
There's something a bit crook here.

4320:
Not looking to get into a blue with any of the local bitsers.

4800:
I'm lookin' at gettin' pounded here!

5280:
Now wussat?

5760:
What's that then?

6240:
Sod it, me gun's empty.

6720:
I'm hit... Christ, I'm hit...

8160:
Thor, that's one hell of a bingle you got yourself in, ya dag. Rest in peace, sport.

8640:
Sorry, I'm, uh, I'm chuckin' a spaz here.

9120:
Oh, no worries, only my flamin' gun's jammed tighter than a fish's arse! Stupid useless load o' codswollip.

9600:
This is hard yakker!

10080:
Strewth, I'm zonked.

10560:
That coulda been a beaut...

11040:
No worries, sport, only I can't be sure of dingin' this one!

11520:
Uhh, gotta bung a bandage on this before I kark it in a pool of blood and piss.

12000:
I wouldn't mind crashin' right about now.

12480:
I'm seriously buggered here. Eh, lemme catch me breath.

12960:
Gotcha, ya nong!

13440:
How's that for a thrashing, ya mongrel?

13920:
Fidel doesn't have the brains to give himself a headache. Damned bushranger.

15360:
I sunk the unsinkable Mike! How do you like that, then? Heh - I'm rather proud of it, meself!

15840:
Strewth, I'm gonna lose me brekkie.

16800:
I'm done! Lookin' for something to do.

17280:
Don't play the raw prawn with me, sport. I'm not gonna do that.

17760:
Hoo-roo! She karked it! She fair dinkum karked it!

18240:
Hoo-roo, mama! Beautiful! Next stop, the waterin' 'ole.

18720:
That bloody boofhead makes me want to chunder.

19200:
This is really crook. I got half a mind to g'wan back to Oz.

19680:
Not a fair dinkum grape in the bunch, if you ask me.

20160:
Heads up, sports!

20640:
These supplies you chucked me aren't worth a brass razoo.

21600:
Americans. What a bunch of sooks.

22080:
Bonza! Persistence pays off.

22560:
Umm...just my say-so, but that'd be a bit of a bollix.

23040:
Had a feeling that was gonna go wrong.

23520:
Well, you picked up Fidel Dahan, then? He's a first-class greaseball, and if I wasn't a man of me word, I'd duck out right now.

25440:
I could tell straight off that Thor was a real cracker!

25920:
Right, well, it's like this. I'd like to give it more of a go before I renew, just to make sure.

26400:
Strewth, it's Mike! This's a fine how'dyado!

26880:
Bloody bug has blinded me!

27360:
This is a pain in the arse. What else be there to do?

27840:
Quite the sport.

28320:
There be a crim about, mate... better be keepin' a close eye.

28800:
You can be sure the crim haven't strayed off too far.

29280:
Hoo-roo. All right, then...

30240:
That's the Joey kid, isn't it?

30720:
Good to be 'ere, mate. In Oz, we got us a saying, "Do unto others, before they do unto you." Now, you just tell the lady, an' I say that lightly, to keep that in her in little noggin.

31200:
Wey hey! They're all dead! Gotta give 'em an "A" for effort, though.

31680:
Easy... a wee bit light on this 'ere, aren't we?

32160:
No worries. She's no lady. She 'ad it coming. I'll bet she's got back hair combed up over 'er shoulders.

32640:
Mountain cat!

33120:
Woo-hoo! We showed 'em who's boss, eh? Purty lot, we are! You know, I reckon I'll be goin' 'ome, but not without thanking you. I 'ad me a regular riot, mate!

33600:
Ah, they buggered outta here.

34080:
Take me a few winks. I get right silly when I don't 'ave me sleep.

34560:
I'm up and right where I was.

35040:
Same here.

35520:
Bloody hell. I'll just bide me time 'til it fixes itself.

36000:
Aw, mate... that there's a right fine trap.

36480:
Aw, no... looks like danger, mate!

36960:
No worries... 'cept I'm drowning!

37440:
Hey, mate, the trek's over.

38400:
Sorry, sport. I hear you're a bit of a galah, and I just don't think we'd click.

38880:
Sure, if I wanted to kark it. Sorry, mate.

39360:
That's a beaut of an offer, but me Mum'll castrate me if I don't make the family reunion this weekend. Next time, right?

39840:
That'd be choice, but I was just heading to the tuckshop. Can't live on bush tucker, right? Chuck me a little more of a head's up next time!

40320:
G'day, owyerdoin'? Trevor and Sheila aren't available, they're at the beach. Just leave me a winge, and they'll give you a bell back.

40800:
It's been a joy, sport! I'm goin' on holiday, spendin' some time with my Sheila. Hoo-roo.

41280:
Sorry, cobber, I'd soon bung me Mum on the barbie than sign-up to work with Fidel. You'll find out why if you keep him on.

42720:
Wanted to ask if you'll be needing my services for another go. Our contract's up, and I'm game for more.

43200:
Fair enough sport, you've been straight with me so far. I'm in.

43680:
I believe I can give it a fair go. I'm right behind ya.

45120:
I've a few bones to pick about the deal sport, but since Thor's with you, that's recommendation enough for me. I'm in.

45600:
Hate to say, I'm not really up for it. This mercenary gig was not as much of a kick as I was hopin' for.

46080:
What I said, was...

46560:
No worries sport, only I'm a little expensive for you at the moment. Bell me when you're flush, and perhaps we'll give it a go then.

47040:
Oh. Well...all right. Sorry I wasn't what you were wantin'. Hoo-roo, then.

47520:
Sure, if I wanted to kark it. Sorry, mate.

48000:
Sorry cobber, I'd soon bung me Mum on the barbie than sign-up to work with Fidel. You'll find out why if you keep him on.

50400:
I've a few bones to pick about the deal sport, but since Thor's with you, that's recommendation enough for me. I'm in.

50880:
What I said, was...

51360:
No worries sport only... I'm a little expensive for you at the moment. Bell me when you're flush, and perhaps we'll give it a go then.

51840:
Trevor Colby here. Owyerdoin'?

52320:
If you're looking for a mechanic, I don't think you'll find anyone better'n me, sport. Least I hope not.

52800:
BO-RING!

53280:
How long d'ya want me? Y'know, a long contract gets you the most bang for your buck.

53760:
I'm a busy boy. Bell me when you're feelin' chatty.

54240:
I should warn you mate, I'm not too happy about havin' that wanker Fidel on the team. Hope 'e stays outta my way.

55200:
Almost 'bout time for me to say, "See ya," mate.

55680:
Look at me, mate! Ya know yer gettin' value for the dollar.
