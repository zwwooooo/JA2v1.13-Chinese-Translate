6720:
Somebody get over here! I got some serious wounds...

7200:
I can't kill Magic! He's my friend! Of course, I'd get to console his wife...

9120:
The firing pin's stuck!

9600:

10560:

It's gonna be a pleasure doing away with that showboat Lynx!

15360:
We got it done!

15840:
I'm messed up good!

16320:
No dice!

16800:
I'm done! Ready to roll...

17280:
Your command is pathetic... I ain't sticking it out with you!

17760:
I was framed! And I've repented!

18240:
We got it done!

18720:
I shouldn't have given him the chance!

19200:
You have any idea how many trees you killed?

19680:
Come on out... I promise I won't hurt you.

20160:
Heads up!

20640:
This thing is useless!

22080:
I'm in a better mood.

22560:
Whenever you want to start!

23040:
Listening to you has been a waste of time!

23520:
There's only one person I won't work with, and you signed him up. Ditch that showboat Lynx, or I'm outta here!

24480:
My man Magic!

25920:
Later loser!

26400:
Bad time to be cheap!

Sorry sweetheart... But when I finally get around to it, I'm going to do it right!

31200:
That's one less gang to worry about!

32160:
We got it done!

32640:
Heads up!

33120:
I was framed! And I've repented!

33600:
You're joking, right!

34080:
I messed up.

34560:
Come again!

35040:
We understand each other!

35520:
This thing is useless!

36000:
It's set to take somebody's legs.

36480:
It's set to take somebody's legs.

36960:
I'm goin' under, man...

37440:
All right! We're on our way.

38400:
Offering petty amounts of cash doesn't take care of problems, it causes 'em!

38880:
No thanks! If I had wanted to die, I would have asked for the chair!

39360:
I appreciate the second chance, but I don't need it!

39840:
No dice! I didn't escape to get a weekend job working for you!

40320:
Looks good... I'm just gonna wait on a couple of calls, and I'll be talking to ya...

40800:
Give me a shout if you need me.

41280:
I don't work with Lynx!

42720:
Time's running out!

43200:
Yeah, you can count me in!

43680:
You got me! Can't say I'm disappointed.

44160:
I'll join... But only because my man, Magic, is workin' for ya.

45600:
No dice! I'll root for the underdog, but I draw the line at signing on with a known loser!

46080:
Like I already told you...

46560:
What do you think I am? An honest criminal? Kudos for the cash. We'll catch you another time!

47040:
I'm outta here... Before the grim reaper pulls my number!

47520:
No dice! Magic tells me you fire people for sport!

48000:
I quit! You don't keep your team tight enough! Straighten it out, and I'll think about joining up again.

49440:
Magic bought it? Now I'm really ticked!

50880:
Like I already told you...

51360:
This gets better all the time! We'll break the tie by you upping the amount of cash I get up-front.

51840:
Get the money, and we'll talk!

52320:
I wasn't in prison THAT long!

52800:
It was a racist, rogue cop! That's the only reason I got time. That...and no money for a defense team!

53280:
Things are too hot right now. I gotta keep low.

53760:
And you ain't wasting my time trying to buy your way around it.

54240:
I see they got Lynx on their squad.

55200:
I gotta stay put. The warden will give up soon enough.

55680:
This is the deal, I'm a popular man... The team offering the most cash gets me.
