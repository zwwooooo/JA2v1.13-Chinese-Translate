0:
有敌人。

480:
我们有麻烦了。

960:
我受不了了！

1440:
我发现了一个……随便你叫它什么。

1920:
圣母玛丽亚，这究竟是些什么怪东西？

2400:
那些大家伙一定是从这儿来的。

2880:
我不知道刚才听到了什么，但我可不喜欢。

3360:
呃……真臭，就象那些大怪物。

3840:
我不喜欢这么静。

4320:
但愿不要一头撞进大怪物的怀里去。

4800:
敌众我寡，不公平！

5280:
那是什么？

5760:
那儿好象有什么东西。

6240:
没子弹的枪可没什么用处。

6720:
希望我看起来不象感觉那么糟。

8640:
我脑子有点乱，请再说一遍。

9120:
这枪堵了。

9600:
我呆不下去了！

10080:
这点伤算什么。

10560:
突然间，我庆幸还能活着。

11040:
对于这一枪我不是很有信心。

11520:
有人给我止血吗？

12000:
我要站着睡着了。

12480:
让我喘口气。

12960:
又干掉一个。

13440:
干掉一个。

15840:
我讨厌看见那些东西。

16800:
我干完了。

17280:
我不能执行那个命令。

17760:
好了，回家吧，这儿没什么可看的。

18240:
我相信这些怪物不是无缘无故在这里的……但是，我还不知道具体原因。

18720:
不愿说他，多失败的可怜虫啊。

19200:
我觉得我在这儿不仅帮不上忙，而且对我也没好处。

19680:
我觉得每个人在这队里的只是为自己。

20160:
敌人的飞机正在接近。

20640:
我现有的东西不是该修理了就是该更新了，这样子是没法去打仗的。

22080:
进步了，感觉不错。

22560:
我认为我们需要一个更好的方法。

23040:
我一点都不奇怪,事情并不象我们预料的那样。

26400:
那个飞行员是个疯子，这飞机飞得让我都吐出来的，噢，对了……该去找Miguel去了。

26880:
噢，打着我的眼睛了，啊，好疼！

27360:
实际上，我想我可以做别的事。

27840:
真希望也能在别的境况下遇见她。

28320:
有敌军接近。

28800:
至少还有一个未被解决，正躲在某处准备在合适的时间给我们一个惊喜呢。

29280:
这玩艺儿让我兴奋。

30240:
那不是Joey Graham吗？

30720:
有我们在，她别想猖獗。我保证。

31200:
我们胜一局，敌人死绝了。

31680:
这儿看上去被偷了，货物不见了。

32160:
也许我是冷血和斤斤计较了点，但我敢说这个女人恶贯满盈，这里的人们兴许会给我们举办一个庆功游行的。

32640:
美洲狮！

33120:
The people in Arulco can sleep a little easier tonight. Only thing that might fall from the skies will be rain. Well done, once again, from beginning to end.

33600:
他们一定溜走了，这儿没有敌人了。

34080:
我要抓紧睡一会儿然后马上回来工作。

34560:
我休息够了，可以继续工作了。

35040:
这正是我想说的。

35520:
保养不利，才会这样。现在它就是一堆废材料！

36000:
这儿到处都写着“死亡”。

36480:
当心，我最好离它远点。

36960:
给我……一根救生缆！我要……淹死了！来人……

37440:
顺利到达，准备好了，下面做什么？

37920:
Now that the laptop is working again, it might be time to bring in some fresh meat.

38400:
Okay... All my body parts are accounted for.

38880:
Somebody should take away your license... If you even have one.

39360:
We should get moving. It isn't getting any warmer standing here.

39840:
Looks like we've hit a dead end... There has to be a way to open that door downstairs.

40320:
Ya... Let me just catch the next bus to Memphis. In case you've forgotten, there's no way back.

40800:
This is absolutely crazy. We're gonna freeze to death.

41280:
Looks like we found the beehive. I say we smoke these guys out good.

41760:
This whole town needs a good decorator.

42240:
It's warming up, but my cheeks are still burning.

42720:
Team's gotten smaller. Sure hope there's no blood on the fan.

43200:
With noise like that who needs doorbells. I guess it's safe to say we'll be expected.

43680:
Looks like everyone's accounted for. No one's gonna have to wash the fan blade after all.

44160:
Maybe our company should come up with some policies of its own. Like not letting annoying store clerks live.

44640:
What is it with armsdealers and attitude? Do they all share the same mother?

45120:
You haven't got a clue, do you?

45600:
Anybody else I wouldn't buy into, but there's something about Rudy that tells me he's on the up and up.

46080:
You rebels sure get around. Good to have you with us, Manuel.

46560:
I'll be keeping an eye on you, Biggens. Your loyalty strays so much as an inch and I'll pull the trigger myself.

47040:
I was beginning to believe that there weren't any men left like you, Kulba. How naive of me. Let's hope you got what it takes.

47520:
So, you used to be with A.I.M. huh, Tex? I hear those were the days. Been awhile though, hasn't it?

48000:
Hey, this is a new toy. Too Much...

48480:
I don't even want to think about what would happen if someone was caught in there with the blades turning.

48960:
I doubt your own mother will even miss you.

49440:
Pass that note to me.

49920:
All right! I give it a nine! That place won't need an address anymore.

50400:
Looks like we got more than just border guards to deal with.

50880:
It looks really old. I wonder if it still works.

51360:
I hate those cats! I hope that's all of them.

51840:
Got to admit... That's one tough act to follow. Though I don't think it was planned.

52320:
Too bad his stuff didn't blow clear. There's nothing left of it.

52800:
Would have been nice to have something to cut through this with... I'll have to use the old fashion way - a good boot. Gonna make an awful lot of noise though.

53280:
I don't even think the door has a keyhole. Getting it open won't be a picnic.

53760:
Well... That sure did something. I felt the whole building shake.

54240:
Haven't got a clue what that noise is all about.

54720:
Time to make our move, before that fan starts turning again.

55200:
Humph... This is interesting. Has the coordinates for all the potential targets on it. Most of them towns in Arulco... Probably wouldn't be too hard to reverse a few things and make this facility the target.

55680:
I'll have to figure out how the control panel works... Then I'll need a clear route to make a fast getaway. The elevator over there would probably do the job.
