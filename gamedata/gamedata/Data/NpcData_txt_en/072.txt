Hmm. I'm surprised. Nobody ever comes back.

My dad put me in charge of wrecking stuff. That's my job. Vice-President of wrecking stuff.

2880:
Heh heh heh. Careful. You're EXCITING me.

3360:
No. I don't see myself working with you.

Blood! He he... Lots of blood.

4320:
I got nothing else to say.

4800:
Hey! No more blood.

Yeah... It sure sounds like fun. I was thinking of killin' her myself, but a...some company might be all right. Just don't be gettin' in my way, cause I won't let anything get in my way.
