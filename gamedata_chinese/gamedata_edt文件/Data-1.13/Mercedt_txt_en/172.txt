0:
I can feel you're here...

480:
My trigger finger's itchy...

960:
Hey! Easy now...not all at the same time!

1440:
Come here...I have a soft spot for rare animals.

1920:
Did you see that? Wow, what an animal.

2400:
Well, at least they're thorough...like Jurassic Park here, eh?

2880:
What was that?

3360:
That smell's unbelievable. These animals stink like a sewer in flood.

3840:
Hear anything? Me neither. Suspicious...I don't like it.

4320:
I think they're here. Come on out, you slimeballs, I'm waitin' for you.

4800:
Dammit, there's too many of 'em!

5280:
Somethin' lyin' there.

5760:
There's somethin' here.

6240:
Hah, out of ammo! Who needs it anyway?

6720:
Dammit, I'm hit.

7200:
Janno! No! We Estonians have to stick together. You can't just die on me. Hey, I'll buy you your favorite food...

8160:
You weren't bad for a Russian, Victor.

8640:
Time for some keep fit exercises.

9120:
I just love this thing when it jams!

9600:
I've killed better guys than you.

10080:
That was tough...but I'm tougher.

10560:
Wow! I felt the draught of that bullet.

11040:
Shoot to hit a target? Are you serious?

11520:
I'm losing blood.

12000:
Got to get some shuteye before I fall asleep on my feet.

12480:
Breathe!!

12960:
Whack...haa!

13440:
One more for my collection.

13920:
Chinese make me clazy.

14880:
A real arrogant bigmouth, that Lynx.

15360:
Well, Mike, Lenni was faster, haa.

15840:
Yeh, life's a bitch...

16320:
Night missions...not one of my strong points.

16800:
Ready.

17280:
That's an order I can't accept.

17760:
I once had a girl like her.

18240:
I knew I'd be the one to get you.

18720:
There are scumbags...and scumbags.

19200:
If I hadn't listened to you Janno, I'd be somewhere nice havin' fun right now.

19680:
I'd even trust a survival camp platoon more than this damn outfit.

20160:
Air attack!

20640:
Shitty equipment really gets on my nerves.

21120:
These people have a lot to learn. They have to put more into it.

21600:
I once saw a video of Arulco. But this is different. Interesting place.

22080:
Improving all the time!

22560:
That would be counter-productive.

23040:
I saw that comin'.

23520:
You want me to cooperate with Mr. Oriental Wisdom Q himself?

24480:
Yeh, Janno. They call him "Brain", did you know that?

25440:
Victor, that was impressive. You know I'm no Russian lover, but you're OK.

25920:
I suppose you've noticed that I have Kamikaze blood in me, hm? But the way things look right now, I think I'll wait a little before I extend my contract.

26400:
No...! That's Mike!

26880:
I can't see!

27360:
No, can't do it.

27840:
Nice place, nice climate - no wonder folks in Siberia act different.

28320:
This is an enemy sector. Want to bug him a little?

28800:
This party isn't over yet.

29280:
What is that?

29760:
Nice weapon.

30240:
Is that not...Joey?

30720:
Ahem...we're honored - these Latin American freedom fighters are always so dramatic.

31200:
This sector's clean.

31680:
Who arranged this deal? I want his balls for breakfast - there's stuff missing here!

32160:
She reminded me of an old girlfriend - what was her name again...

32640:
A Bloodcat!

33120:
That was a lot of fun - and we won! It was well planned and carried out even better.

33600:
Where have they all gone? Party poopers.

34080:
I have to take a break now....

34560:
I'm back!

35040:
Me too!

35520:
This thing doesn't work.

36000:
Well, doesn't this look like a nice trap? Do I hear something ticking?

36480:
Easy...there's something on the ground there.

36960:
Dammit, I'm drowning!

37440:
I'm on site and ready.

38400:
It's no fun when someone is as incompetent like you...the answer's no.

38880:
You might be generous, but only with the lives of your own people. I don't like that at all.

39360:
My girl is ...sick. I have to take care of her.

39840:
I don't like being left hanging until the last minute. Ask me sooner next time.

40320:
This is Lennart Vilde. If you something interesting to offer, please speak after the beep tone.

40800:
Looks like we're finished here. Time to go.

41280:
Listen to Dr. Q spiritualizing the whole day long? Sorry.

42240:
There's a small problem here. If this Lynx says more than 2 words, he's dead. That's not so good for your team spirit.

42720:
Wouldn't mind extending for you...anything doing?

43200:
OK, deal.

43680:
OK, I'm hurrying.

44160:
OK, if Janno is on the team, no problem. He at least knows what he's doing...

45120:
Victor is a professional, if he's signed up, that's OK by me.

45600:
No thanks. Try somebody else. Our last mission was enough for me.

46080:
I'll say it again...

46560:
Have you had a look at your money recently?

47040:
I don't think you know what you really want.

47520:
I don't like how you treat the lives and the health of your people. You have no style.

48000:
I see Chinese dangel! Solly, I leally cannot extend my contlact.

48960:
That Lynx kills the whole mission for me. Sorry, but I think I'll look for another contract.

49440:
Hey, if Janno is on board, I am too. We make a good team.

50400:
I suppose I should know better...but if Victor stays maybe we have a chance.

50880:
I'm telling you...

51360:
Thanks for asking, but you don't expect me to work for nothing, do you?

51840:
Lennart here, hello...

52320:
A night mission...now that would be nice for my shooting skills.

52800:
What are we waiting for?

53280:
For a month, a year...what are we talking about here?

53760:
Think first - then call.

54240:
The China wonder boy and me leally don't make velly good team.

55200:
Just to remind you, my contract is soon up.

55680:
My performance has improved, so my pay has to match that. You know I'm worth it...
