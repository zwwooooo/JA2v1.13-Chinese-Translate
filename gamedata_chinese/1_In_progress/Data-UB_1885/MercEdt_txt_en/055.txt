0:
Enemy in view.

480:
We've got trouble.

960:
I'm overloaded here!

1440:
We got one of those whatchamacallits.

1920:
Holy Mother of...what the hell do you call that?

2400:
Those giant thingamabobs must've come this way.

2880:
I don't know what I just heard, but I don't like it.

3360:
Ecch...smells rotten, like one of those big whatever-they-ares.

3840:
I don't like how quiet it is.

4320:
Sure hope we don't bump into a big whozeewhatsis.

4800:
These things aren't playing fair!

5280:
What's that?

5760:
There seems to be something over there.

6240:
An empty weapon is never good.

6720:
Hope I don't look as bad as I feel.

8640:
I got distracted. Give it to me again.

9120:
This gun's jammed.

9600:
I'm in the hotseat here!

10080:
Was that supposed to hurt?

10560:
Suddenly I feel really glad to be alive.

11040:
I'm not very confident about that shot.

11520:
Permission to stop bleeding, somebody?

12000:
I'm about to fall asleep on my feet.

12480:
Need to breathe.

12960:
Another down.

13440:
Killed one.

15840:
I hate to look at that kind of thing.

16800:
I'm finished my task.

17280:
I can't comply with that order.

17760:
All right, go home, there's nothing to see here.

18240:
I've got to believe that thing was here for a reason...but damned if I know what that could've been.

18720:
Hate to say it, but what a loser.

19200:
I don't feel like I'm doing any good here. And being here isn't doing me much good either.

19680:
I get the feeling that everybody on this team is only out for themselves.

20160:
Enemy planes approaching.

20640:
Everything I've got either needs repair or replacement. This is no way to wage a battle.

22080:
Improvement. Feels good.

22560:
I believe we need a better approach.

23040:
I'm hardly surprised that didn't go as intended.

26400:
That chopper pilot's a madman. He made me nauseous. Oh, well... It's off to find Miguel.

26880:
Ow, got me in the eyes. Ah, they're on fire!

27360:
Surely, there's something else I could be doing.

27840:
Wish I met her under other circumstances.

28320:
There are enemies in proximity.

28800:
There's at least one of them isn't accounted for. Could be waiting for the right moment to surprise us.

29280:
Here's something to perk up my day.

30240:
Isn't that Joey Graham over there?

30720:
Not with us here, she won't. Count on it.

31200:
One for our side! All enemies are down.

31680:
It appears there's been a theft here. Stuff's missing.

32160:
Forgive me for being cold and calculating, but that woman was a complete zero in any book. They'll probably throw us a parade.

32640:
Cougar!

33120:
The people in Arulco can sleep a little easier tonight. Only thing that might fall from the skies will be rain. Well done, once again, from beginning to end.

33600:
They musta slipped out. No enemy presence in the sector.

34080:
I'll grab a few z's and get back on the job.

34560:
Rested and returning to work.

35040:
I was just going to say that.

35520:
Maintenance could have prevented this. Now, it's nothing but dead weight.

36000:
This's got "deadly" written all over it.

36480:
Watch out. I'd keep my toes off of that.

36960:
Need a... line here! I'm... drowning! Anyone...

37440:
Safe arrival. I'm prepared for the next assignment.

37920:
Now that the laptop is working again, it might be time to bring in some fresh meat.

38400:
Okay... All my body parts are accounted for.

38880:
Somebody should take away your license... If you even have one.

39360:
We should get moving. It isn't getting any warmer standing here.

39840:
Looks like we've hit a dead end... There has to be a way to open that door downstairs.

40320:
Ya... Let me just catch the next bus to Memphis. In case you've forgotten, there's no way back.

40800:
This is absolutely crazy. We're gonna freeze to death.

41280:
Looks like we found the beehive. I say we smoke these guys out good.

41760:
This whole town needs a good decorator.

42240:
It's warming up, but my cheeks are still burning.

42720:
Team's gotten smaller. Sure hope there's no blood on the fan.

43200:
With noise like that who needs doorbells. I guess it's safe to say we'll be expected.

43680:
Looks like everyone's accounted for. No one's gonna have to wash the fan blade after all.

44160:
Maybe our company should come up with some policies of its own. Like not letting annoying store clerks live.

44640:
What is it with armsdealers and attitude? Do they all share the same mother?

45120:
You haven't got a clue, do you?

45600:
Anybody else I wouldn't buy into, but there's something about Rudy that tells me he's on the up and up.

46080:
You rebels sure get around. Good to have you with us, Manuel.

46560:
I'll be keeping an eye on you, Biggens. Your loyalty strays so much as an inch and I'll pull the trigger myself.

47040:
I was beginning to believe that there weren't any men left like you, Kulba. How naive of me. Let's hope you got what it takes.

47520:
So, you used to be with A.I.M. huh, Tex? I hear those were the days. Been awhile though, hasn't it?

48000:
Hey, this is a new toy. Too Much...

48480:
I don't even want to think about what would happen if someone was caught in there with the blades turning.

48960:
I doubt your own mother will even miss you.

49440:
Pass that note to me.

49920:
All right! I give it a nine! That place won't need an address anymore.

50400:
Looks like we got more than just border guards to deal with.

50880:
It looks really old. I wonder if it still works.

51360:
I hate those cats! I hope that's all of them.

51840:
Got to admit... That's one tough act to follow. Though I don't think it was planned.

52320:
Too bad his stuff didn't blow clear. There's nothing left of it.

52800:
Would have been nice to have something to cut through this with... I'll have to use the old fashion way - a good boot. Gonna make an awful lot of noise though.

53280:
I don't even think the door has a keyhole. Getting it open won't be a picnic.

53760:
Well... That sure did something. I felt the whole building shake.

54240:
Haven't got a clue what that noise is all about.

54720:
Time to make our move, before that fan starts turning again.

55200:
Humph... This is interesting. Has the coordinates for all the potential targets on it. Most of them towns in Arulco... Probably wouldn't be too hard to reverse a few things and make this facility the target.

55680:
I'll have to figure out how the control panel works... Then I'll need a clear route to make a fast getaway. The elevator over there would probably do the job.
