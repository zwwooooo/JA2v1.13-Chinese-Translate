Hello, my name is Bruce.

480:
Hello...

960:
Lovely weather, shame about the hostilities. Danubia was an OK place years ago.

1440:
I don't know why I volunteered for that crazy assignment last week.

1920:
I am not really set up for bartering. However, I do accept all the major credit cards.

2400:
I miss my cat Fluffy.

2880:
Have I done something to upset you?

3360:
I'm not really a man of violence. I shoot pictures, not guns.

3840:
I was afraid this would happen...

4320:
I have some negatives to develop. If you need me, I'll be here.

4800:
Thank you. I'm sure you'll be satisfied with the vest.

5280:
I have a very unique item. It's something I believe might interest you: advanced body armor of the highest quality. I could let it go for, say, $1000 dollars.

5760:
You don't owe me any money.

6240:
And how will you be paying for that?

6720:
I'm willing to put my faith in you. You seem trustworthy, and I sense this may be my only chance... My partner Miranda Cruz was arrested while breaking into Crepaton headquarters in Adrian. We were on an assignment together.

7200:
Our editor Mr. Hearse is a fearless crusader seeking to expose the truth about corruption, so Miranda volunteered us to find some dirt. That girl is a total lunatic. She wanted me to photograph documents for her.

7680:
In Crepaton headquarters! Unbelievable! So we pretend to be cleaners and go rummaging through cabinets after the offices have closed. So she says there must be good stuff in the locked drawers, then an alarm goes off.

8160:
She passes me a handful of documents and yells run for it. I escaped, but they have her locked up in the Port Kip police station. If you can manage to get her out, return here. Mr. Hearse will arrange our safe exit from the country.

8640:
Miranda! Can it be true? You're free, it's a miracle!

9120:
You have done exactly as I asked. I will be forever grateful! We have no need for these documents now. Mr. Hearse will pay you well for the information.  Please... Take them to him.

10080:
Miranda has told me she knows Mr. Klaus is interested in obtaining something called a MOC list. I have no idea what this is but I believe he is willing to pay a great deal for it.

10560:
He is a brutal man, engaged in various criminal enterprises and always protected by a retinue of bodyguards. I believe he has connections with Satan's Sons, so be very careful around him.

12000:
Must be All Saints Day in Danubia. We have to move quickly. Call Mr. Hearse and tell him you're safe. We need to exit this country immediately. Mr. Hearse had better lay low himself if he publishes that stuff I gave you.

13920:
If you want me to help you, you must rescue my partner Miranda. If you harm me, your karma will be heavily in the black.

15360:
You're a complete lunatic!

15840:
That's not enough. I asked for $1000.

16320:
That's too much. I don't have change. Do you have the exact amount?

16800:
Ah, shit this floor tastes awful, but better than catching a stray bullet. Talk to me when the shooting stops.

17280:
