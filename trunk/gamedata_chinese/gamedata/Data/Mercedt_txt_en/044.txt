0:
Oh, my!

480:
Oh, non, I had hoped we would not be meeting them now!

960:
I want to go home!

1440:
Mon Dieu, another one!

1920:
Mon Dieu! What in the world is that? I cannot believe it! I do not want to believe it.

2400:
Zut alors! The horrible things have been this way!

2880:
There is a noise!

3360:
I recognize that foul odor! It's the odor of those horrible creatures!

3840:
I sense that we are entering the door of danger.

4320:
I will just die if I have to see another one of those terrible monsters!

4800:
Help! Help!

5280:
Look there.

5760:
What is that I see?

6240:
My gun is void of ammo!

6720:
I don't want to die here...not here...don't let me die here.

7200:
Mon Dieu, Biff, you can't be dead! My poor Biff! Surely we should turn back now and go home, simply out of respect for Biff, yes?

8160:
Oh, Lynx, what a waste! Such beauty, such skill... and your hands, I love your hands... this is too sad, I cannot possibly go on. Perhaps I leave this Godforsaken place now.

8640:
The stress is beginning to affect my thoughts...

9120:
Now my gun is jammed! This is hopeless!

9600:
This is insanity! I'm going to be killed!

10080:
For a moment, I thought I was with the angels. Now I find I'm still in this enfer. My suffering knows no bounds.

10560:
They have alarmed my fear. I am terrified of death.

11040:
That is an impossible target.

11520:
Spilling blood for this cursed mission. How much more am I expected to do?

12000:
I feel faint. I simply cannot go on without sleep.

12480:
The air of Arulco is heavy. I am suffocated.

12960:
I killed somebody!

13440:
It is dead.

14880:
This Meltdown, she is not a woman at all. She is an affront to the female sex!

15360:
I cannot stand to be with Meltdown any longer. She is offensive and unfeminine and deserves only contempt. Good luck to you. I want no more of this!

15840:
That is revolting!

16320:
I don't believe I can go through with this... I am terrified.

16800:
Is there something else for me to do?

17280:
Absolutely not. I am nobody's dog.

17760:
She's dead. By my hand. I sense a feeling of power for the first time in my life. I like it!

18240:
All right, she's dead. I must get out of here and shower, or I will never feel clean again.

18720:
I hate to waste my brain thinking about that fool.

19200:
Right now, I would like to be back in my apartment, taking a hot bath and sipping champagne. Perhaps, I might be inspired to forget I was ever here.

19680:
The lowest of the low, the dust of humanity!

20160:
Enemy planes heading directly for us!

20640:
Don't we deserve something better than these crude implements? I cannot be at war without decent implements!

21120:
Mon Dieu! How do I find myself in this... I am terrified. My nerves are frail. I dream of being safe under the covers of my bed.

22080:
I make progress, non?

22560:
Perhaps there is a method that makes more sense?

23040:
I foresaw this! Not that anyone would have listened to me!

24480:
Excellent, Biff! Is it any wonder I like you...that is, like working with you so much?

25440:
You see now? Trust Lynx!

25920:
This job is taxing my sanity and not taxing my pocketbook. I am sorry. I can take this no longer. I leave now.

26880:
Merde! I have lost my eyes.

27360:
It is my fear that you have asked the wrong person.

27840:
Someone I would enjoy knowing more deeply.

28320:
The enemy is present.

28800:
Hopefully, someone will locate the remaining enemies, so they will no longer be a danger to me, eh... us.

29760:
Oh, mon dieu! That was more satisying than an orgasm.

30240:
Finalement. We have located the lost boy.

30720:
Oh well. It was fun while it lasted, non?

31200:
Tres bon! The enemies are no more.

31680:
Attend, something is missing here.

32160:
She was no good. She deserved all that come upon her and, perhaps, more.

32640:
Chat!

33120:
I wish there were champagne so we could celebrate with civility. But then, good friends are the most important thing.

33600:
The enemy, he has retreated.

34080:
I must sleep now. I will be much better when I wake.

34560:
I am up now, and starting where I stopped.

35040:
Mais oui! Me, too.

35520:
I cannot work with this... this stuff. It is broken.

36000:
Look! Careful, I think it holds danger.

36480:
Hmm. I think the enemy is trying to conceal something terrible.

36960:
Mon dieu! I am... drowning!

37440:
I have arrived! Something I can do now?
