Enemy soldier present.

480:
I've crept into an enemy.

960:
Enemy soldiers!

1440:
That's disgusting.

1920:
It looks dangerous.

2400:
How could this happen?

2880:
What's the deal again?

3360:
The atmosphere here is gloomy.

3840:
They're telling some pretty funny stories about you around here!

4320:
I'm not scared! You think being a mime is easy?

4800:
Margaret!

5280:
Caught a glimpse of something.

5760:
Oh, look!

6240:
Need ammunition urgently.

6720:
It feels like I'm... I'm on my last breath...

7200:
How could this happen? I just moved into Margaret's place. Is she really dead?

8640:
What's the deal again?

9120:
When I pull the trigger nothing happens!

9600:
I'm a target!

10080:
Take five?

10560:
They aren't kidding!

11040:
It will be tricky.

11520:
This is real blood I'm spilling.

12000:
Right now I just want to live through the day.

12480:
Take five?

12960:
Good show!

13440:
Good show!

13920:
Fox is a whore. A cheap whore with wondering eyes, who should be killed slowly with deliberate pain and plenty of suffering. I'm so excited!

15360:
I'm sorry...

15840:
That's disgusting.

16320:
The atmosphere here is gloomy.

16800:
Our goal has been accomplished.

17280:
I won't do that.

17760:
Good show! She's gone.

18240:
Right now? I'm just grateful to be alive.

18720:
It's quite apparent that you and I will never reach a compromise.

19200:
Despite our best intentions, we will not be able to complete our goal.

19680:
I passed around the hat far too many times in my previous career.

20160:
Margaret!

20640:
It's garbage.

21120:
Margaret said it would be non-stop action. Well this place has about as much action as most of the street corners I performed on.

21600:
I could move in right behind you and you'd never know it!

22080:
I acquired some battle experience. Perhaps it will lead to more work. Thank you.

22560:
I'm not convinced you know what you're doing.

23040:
I can't see how I can stay.

23520:
Oh look. It's that harlot Guzzman!

24480:
I know Margaret comes off as a bit of a hard shell, but she's really a pussycat once you get to know her.

25920:
I've been lucky enough to receive a number of offers. I'm soliciting a signing bonus from anyone who's interrested in employing me.

26400:
We're reaching the final stage.

26880:
Margaret!

27360:
I'm not strong enough.

27840:
Keep talking.

28320:
Right now? I just want to live through the day.

28800:
I'm just grateful to be alive.

29280:
Though my knowledge is limited, we appear to have made out like bandits on the deal.

30240:
Oh, look!

30720:
You must have been hard pressed to have asked me.

31200:
We've cancelled that troop's ticket.

31680:
My knowledge of these type of things is limited. However, there's no mistaking the fact that you were severely ripped off.

32160:
We were unable to reach any type of compromise.

32640:
It looks dangerous.

33120:
Despite some frightening moments it was really quite a thrill.

33600:
I never imagined being a mercenary would be this easy!

34080:
Give me a little while.

34560:
I just want to live through the day.

35040:
Keep talking.

35520:
It's garbage.

36000:
It looks dangerous.

36480:
I don't know much about booby traps, but those bumps in the ground sure look weird.

36960:
I can't go much longer! I'm going under!

37440:
I just got there.

38400:
I'm pretty new at this. I wouldn't be comfortable not knowing who I was going to be working with on any given day.

38880:
It's not possible. Working for you seems too dangerous at the moment.

39360:
And you may recall that we were unable to reach any type of compromise before, so there isn't much point in trying again.

39840:
Well, I didn't get shot at the party, but I did get Salmonella poisoning from undercooked barbacue. I won't be able to make it.

40320:
I'm performing at a birthday party. I don't get paid very well, but at least I know I won't get shot.

40800:
It's quite apparent that you and I will never reach a compromise.

41280:
I can't work with Fox. She's causing all kinds of trouble. It's only a question of time before somebody on the team pays a price for her behaviour.

42720:
Oh, I've forgot all about this dinner dance tonight being put on by the society of lesbian mimes.

43200:
You're offering the best package, so I'm joining with you.

43680:
I don't see why not. Sure, I'm in.

44160:
Working with Stella would be real special. Alright, I'll ignore my concerns about you for the chance.

45600:
The atmosphere here is gloomy. Nothing ever goes right and nothing gets done. When you're serious about completing a mission you can call me.

46080:
Would you like me to act it out for you? I said...

46560:
The way it was explained to me you have to have the cash on you.

47040:
I'm going to leave now and see if I can't hook up with a more stable assingment.

47520:
I'm new at this and too many of our people are getting killed. I'm not taking any more chances. I'm leaving.

48000:
I can't work with Fox. She's causing all kinds of trouble. It's only a question of time before somebody on the team pays a price for her behaviour.

49440:
Margaret and I are a team.

50880:
Would you like me to act it out for you? I said...

51360:
I'm sorry but you simply aren't offering the best package.

51840:
I am as quiet as a mouse... That is, after all, how I got my nickname.

52320:
Keep talking.

52800:
Why did you even ask me to come?

53280:
We might be able to work something out. Give me a little while to think about it.

53760:
I really don't think so. I'm not convinced you know what you're doing.

54240:
Fox, she's flaunting herself and making the situation unnecessarily dangerous for everybody.

55200:
Wow! Margaret said it wouldn't be too long before I saw action and made some money.

55680:
For the new girl in town I seem to be doing alright. A raise already!
