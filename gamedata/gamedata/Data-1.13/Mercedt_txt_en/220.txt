Another customer!

480:
This one's too stupid to even know I'm here!

960:
There's a line-up.

1440:
Where's my pepper spray?

1920:
You can't trust the government.

2400:
I don't think so...

2880:
There's a mad rush.

3360:
I don't think so...

3840:
It looks like it could be trouble.

4320:
It looks like it could be trouble.

4800:
Where's my pepper spray?

5280:
More stuff.

5760:
More stuff.

6240:
No ammo! I need a resupply!

6720:
I'm going need serious medical attention if I'm going to live to collect my disability.

7200:
I'm gonna get the son-of-a-bitch who killed Reuban and send tiny parts of his body to every state in the continental U.S. of A. Postage due!

9120:
Gun's screwed!

9600:
I've seen more gunfire at the postal station.

10080:
I don't get paid enough for this.

10560:
He doesn't know who he's shooting at!

11040:
Everyone always wants the impossible.

11520:
Doesn't look like the bleeding is going to stop.

12000:
Either I take a short break now, or I'm lying down for a long one.

12480:
I pulled out my back...

12960:
Next!

13440:
Next!

13920:
I hate snitches! I had one of those Bud Hellar types down at the postal station. Second week on the job, he disappeared. The same thing's gonna happen to Bud!

15360:
It's done... Hope you're happy.

15840:
That's impressive!

16320:
Ah... To hell!

16800:
It's done... Hope you're happy.

17280:
I won't be able to make it. I can't be everywhere!

17760:
Once I'm through with you, they'll be able to bury you in a standard, number eight, Manila envelope!

18240:
I'm bored! I joined for the carnage. Things are far too quiet for me to hang around!

18720:
Your butt is mine, buster! You'd better pray we never cross paths.

19200:
You have no respect for labour!

19680:
I just need a couple of more signatures and A.I.M. is unionised, so you better be careful how you treat your people.

20160:
Cut me some slack!

20640:
It was broken when I got it.

21120:
I'm union. I don't work for anything below scale, and if you find somebody who does, let me know - I'll teach them the error of their ways.

21600:
My lawyer says I have to burn all that mail I've failed to deliver and stashed in my town house. Uh, something about search warrant being excercised later today.

22080:
It's why I joined. Cash, carnage and no more polyester uniforms.

22560:
There's a harebrained idea.

23040:
Oh, this mission is in the toilet!

23520:
I quit! I'd strangle that Bud Whatever-his-name-is! That's if I could get his head out of your butt! If not, I'd just shoot him.

24480:
Reuban's probably the only person on the planet, who I wouldn't enjoy killing. He's cheap labor. Our country was built by guys like him.

25920:
I've called for a boycott of you. The ability to blow money like that could probably get you pretty high ranking government posting.

26400:
He's a heel sucking twerp!

26880:
Someone's gonna have to answer for this!

27360:
Nothing ever does what it's supposed to do.

27840:
Haven't I seen you in somebody else's magazine?

28320:
I was promised carnage! Plenty of carnage!

28800:
Apparently, you've won a rather large amount of money in the Sweepstakes. If you just let me know where I can find you, I'll get you to sign, and be on my way.

29760:
I could take you and that ragamuffin band of paper-pushing, numb-butted, overpaid, insignificants all by myself!

30240:
Now we got to get all the way back.

30720:
Fired!!! I've never been fired! I worked for the post office for twenty-two years and I never missed more than a... month of work in any year!

31200:
Personally, I think we should get a bonus when things go this well.

31680:
You gotta appreciate this. This is better than that old-age paycheck scam we were running, no signatures to forge or anything.

32160:
I don't appreciate affordable labour being abused like that.

32640:
Where's my pepper spray?

33120:
Been there and seen it... There wasn't enough carnage or action to get me to go back.

33600:
We won't be seeing anybody wearing that color any more.

34080:
I'm having my coffee. I'll get back to you when I'm finished.

34560:
Ya... You got me. Just don't go making like you own me.

35040:
I've already told you!

35520:
It was broken when I got it.

36000:
It looks like it could be trouble.

36480:
They insist on changing the route on me...

36960:
I'm going under... It's a bitch there's nobody to take with me...

37440:
Keep your eyes on the clock. I don't do overtime.
