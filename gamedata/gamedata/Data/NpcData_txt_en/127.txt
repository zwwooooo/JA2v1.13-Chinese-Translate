Well, welcome! Eldin Fiddes. I'm your information attendant here, and I double as the security guard, so watch yourself.

480:
Hello kiddo. Miss me, did ya? Heh, heh, heh.

960:
Yeah, it's a good job for a retiree, gotta admit. Hours and work are easy. Say, I remember when I first started doing this. I, huh... um. Shoot. What was I going to say? Ah, it'll come to me.

1440:
Yeah ask me, this war's kind of excitin'. Reminds me of the old days! Even got Commies down here! Heh. I seen a few. Heh heh. And I know what to do with them.

1920:
Uh, no thanks, kiddo.

2400:
Tell ya, there was a day when being a security guard meant reading lotsa books. Ain't the case anymore. In fact, this one time, I... uh, um. God dammit, where was I? Well, couldn'ta been that important.

2880:
Look here. I fought in WWII! Fought with the Americans in the Marine Corp! I ain't afraid of nothing, and if you think you're gonna boss me around just 'cause I'm old, WELL, you got another thing coming!

3360:
Me? Nah. Saw all the action I needed in WWII.

3840:
Soldier! Get me a medic!

4320:
Well, I do have a job to do here.

4800:
Why, thank you. Looking good now.

5280:
You're messin' with a vet!

5760:
You ask me, it's time to take cover, not make conversation.

6240:
Donations to the Museum's Fund are always welcome.

6720:
As the information officer, it's my pleasure to let you know we got Arulco's greatest treasure here. They call it, get this, "The Chalice of Chance."

7200:
Now, I don't know what kinda chance they're talking about. But I do know that they aren't taking any kind of chance with it. Heh heh heh!

7680:
Guess the Queen brought it here, oh, I don't remember when, long, long time ago. Sort of a star attraction for the people of Balime. Been attracting lots of crowds, it has. Go take a look for yourself.

8160:
Say, you really did miss a great exhibit here. Well, I should say that we really miss a great exhibit here. Yeah, The Chalice of Chance. Gone missing recently, and I tell ya, whoever's got it has a nice price on their heads now.

8640:
It was a star attraction here. Visiting it was a daily ritual for the people of Balime. Oh, I'm sure the Queen's just up in arms about it, but it wasn't my fault. Oh, I wasn't here when it happened!

9120:
Anyway, we got other stuff to look at, so you go ahead on through. Pleasure talking to ya.

9600:
'Fraid that's it for tonight, fellas. I gotta be heading on home. You come back and check out the exhibits tomorrow.

10080:
Well, just between you and me, I am getting a little tired of the hours here. You know, I am getting up there in years. Last month or so, I've been puttin' in 15 hours a day! In at 7 and out at 10. That's a bit much.

10560:
Halt! Museum security. Uh...I'll, uh...I'll shoot!
