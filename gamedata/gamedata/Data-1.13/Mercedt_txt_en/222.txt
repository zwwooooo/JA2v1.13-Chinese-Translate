Got a reptile!

480:
I could kill this reptile without being seen.

960:
Encountered some renegades!

1440:
Got a reptile!

1920:
I tell ya! You run into family in the strangest places.

2400:
It can happen to anyone.

2880:
I hear a green platoon...

3360:
It's gonna be dangerous!

3840:
It's gonna be dangerous!

4320:
I'm the only Roachburn for the job.

4800:
C'mon!

5280:
Something here!

5760:
Something here!

6240:
Get me ammo now!

6720:
Ain't gonna make it! Blood everywhere... Make sure my kids don't get a damn thing!

7200:
Sorry Sammy... Old Sammy's been knocked off, huh. Well... We better win this thing in his honor!

8640:
I'm lost!

9120:
Jammed gun!

9600:
What the hell are you doing?

10080:
That's gotta be rough on the pacemaker.

10560:
Can't believe my luck.

11040:
I could save a bullet and wait for a better chance!

11520:
Bleeding here!

12000:
I can't go... I got a kidney stone!

12480:
When do you get to rest in this man's army?

12960:
Chew on that, lightweight!

13440:
Chew on that, lightweight!

13920:
Blooming dogfish... You're worse than Larry!

14400:
Blooming dogfish... You're worse than Larry!

15360:
I should have done this years ago!

15840:
Not too shabby for a rusty, old man!

16320:
I'm lost!

16800:
Colonel Roachburn is back in business.

17280:
Orders like that ain't confidence builders!

17760:
Ah... Just like the old days... Moments worth savoring!

18240:
If you're looking to hire a Roachburn, I'm the only Roachburn for the job!

18720:
I'd have made love with your mother, but I didn't have the exact change!

19200:
The indecisiveness of the incompetent!

19680:
Since you're paying me a good buck, I'll tell you few tales...

20160:
Now would be an excellent time to raise the pay out on your life insurance!

20640:
They don't make these things like they used to.

21120:
Apparently... word hasn't gotten around yet. You made the only offer.

21600:
Just don't compare me to my kids... Heck, I don't even know if they are my kids. Their mother was a tramp. She was raised in a trailer. A tent trailer!

22080:
Feels great to be back! I never shoulda retired.

22560:
Orders like that ain't confidence builders.

23040:
The last time you did that I woke up with a severe rash!

23520:
I can't stand my kids! They're always looking for money or causing me grief. They're just like their spoiled little mother!

24000:
I cant' think of a better way to put some distance between me and my family. They all drive me nuts!

24480:
Sam and I go back at least thirty years.

25920:
What do you figure? I'm gonna take a check for the difference? Come on! I wasn't born yesterday. I got back taxes to take care of... What would you do?

26400:
After I kill you, ligthweight, I'm gonna mount your head just above the fireplace! You'll like it there! You'll have a great view of a lake!

26880:
God... I hope it passes soon!

27360:
Blooming dogfish... 

27840:
I man has gotta have his pride, you know.

28320:
It's combat time!

28800:
It may look peaceful, but it won't last!

29760:
Now would be an excellent time to raise the payout on your life insurance!

30240:
You're just a kid, aren't ya?

30720:
What I do wrong?!

31200:
Platoon annihilated!

31680:
And if they keep paying through their nose for new equipment, they're going be looking for a new line of work.

32160:
There was a time when I thought we could work this out, but you're just a lot of smoke!

32640:
C'mon!

33120:
It was good to get back into the swing of things. I'd probably be up to doing it again, if you needed me.

33600:
Looks like it's my turn to pay!

34080:
Don't hold back.

34560:
Colonel Roachburn is back in business.

35040:
I can't believe the response.

35520:
They don't make these things like they used to.

36000:
It's coming down to the wire. Better watch the clock!

36480:
Whoever attempted to boobytrap this area did a pitiful job at covering their tracks!

36960:
I'm losing strength... Feel weak... I can't swim anymore...

37440:
It would make my day...

39840:
What do you think you are? Family?

40320:
What do you think you are? Family?

42720:
I can't stand being around my kids. They all drive me nuts! Do something about it, or I will.
