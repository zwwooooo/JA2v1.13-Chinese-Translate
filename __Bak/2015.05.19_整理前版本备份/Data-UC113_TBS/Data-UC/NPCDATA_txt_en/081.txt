Cargo Claim, got a claim ticket?

480:
You got some more cargo to claim?

960:
That's right, I'm the cargo claims manager.

1440:
Yeah, the pay ain't great... but it's a living.

1920:
Thanks but no thanks. I got all I need.

2400:
Well if it were up to me I'd nuke the site and call it a day.

2880:
Look pal, I just handle the shippments around here. I don't want any trouble.

3360:
I've got plenty on my plate right now but.

3840:
I... I could use a medic over here.

4320:
I got work to do, if you don't mind.

4800:
I'll be right with you as soon as the gun fire stops.

5280:
What's this?

5760:
Here to pick up some cargo? All I need is your claim ticket please.

6240:
Claim Ticket?

6720:
Let's see, box #05623, hmmm... I think that one's in the back room here.  Follow me please.

7200:
Yep, here it is... box #05623, this one's yours. I hope you find everything you need.

7680:
Actually, I'm kinda suprised that you made it into Danubia. The Prime Minister closed the borders a few days back and no one's been comin' in or going out.

8160:
Not into Danubian News are ya?  Well, it seems some private jet crashed here a few days ago, guess they must 'a thought it was some kinda spy plane or something.

8640:
Rumor has it, there were some survivors, but then again, that's only rumor.  

9120:
Well, I suggest you keep your nose clean there sport.  They got the whole army and police force on Alert. I even heard they got some CIA folks here investigating this stuff.  What a mess.

9600:
If your lookin' for transportation, I suggest you take the Bullet Train, Danubia's Subway System.  You can get to it by takin' those stairs right back there.
