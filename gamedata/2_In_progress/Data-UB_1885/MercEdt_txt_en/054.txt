More aggressors.

480:
They're here. Let's get the show on the road.

960:
I'd like to get outta here while I can still walk!

1440:
Killer chiggers on the loose!

1920:
My God! It's like a...it's like the Six Million Dollar Chigger!

2400:
I think one of those steriod-induced chiggers came through.

2880:
Hear that?

3360:
Ugh-ah, I hope someone just cut the cheese. Otherwise, we're downwind of a rampaging giant chigger.

3840:
Something's setting off my internal alarms.

4320:
Lions and tigers and chiggers...oh, my.

4800:
Get outta my face, chiggers! Shoulda packed some DEET!

5280:
Looky yonder.

5760:
What's lying there?

6240:
This gun's empty.

6720:
I can't feel anything...I'm as close to dead as you get.

8640:
Wait a minute, I lost my bearings. What am I supposed to be doing?

9120:
My goddamned gun is jammed, pardon my French.

9600:
If I don't get outta here, my goose is cooked!

10080:
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

10560:
Well... Better to watch it than feel it.

11040:
Poor chance from here. Maybe from another position.

11520:
If I keep losing blood, sooner or later, I'll black out.

12000:
I'm pooped. I have to sack out for a while.

12480:
I'm out of breath. Give me a sec.

12960:
You're dead, pea brain.

13440:
Rubbed out that chigger!

15840:
There goes my appetite for the next week.

16800:
Ready for something new.

17280:
No. I draw the line.

17760:
I would rather have seen her suffer for a long time...but hey, this'll do.

18240:
Yeah, baby! You make a pretty corpse!

18720:
I know what that idiot's problem is: not enough secondhand smoke!

19200:
Next time, I'll pick a more exciting assignment...like shooting subway rats in Brooklyn.

19680:
Jesus, I hope there's no group photos. I wouldn't want to be seen with this bunch of second grade dropouts.

20160:
Holy moly! They're making a strafing run!

20640:
There isn't enough scotch tape in the world to hold this cruddy equipment together.

22080:
I'm self-taught!

22560:
Pretty cheesy plan.

23040:
And the Golden Turkey award goes to...

26400:
It's a good feeling to have my feet on terra firma. Now, to find that rebel leader Miguel.

26880:
Holy moly! I'm unable to open my eyes.

27360:
Nothing is going to come of this.

27840:
A neighborly kind of fellow.

28320:
Tread carefully. There's aggressors around.

28800:
We didn't get them all, so let's be careful.

29280:
Wow! You don't find one of these every day.

30240:
Kid over there looks like he might be hiding from someone.

30720:
Maybe on a real good day, Miguel, but we just ruined the chances of that. You let us get to work, and things will be fine.

31200:
Yeah! That's a clean sweep! There's no dirt left.

31680:
Hold on. Looks like we have a problem here. Where's the stuff?

32160:
How's that feel, honey? Just so you know, it feels damn good to me, and everybody else around here.

32640:
Dog food!

33120:
Nothing like standing by each other through thick and thin, eh? Thanks for everything, and you know what I mean. I was here from day one.

33600:
Uh, they pulled out. I hate that.

34080:
Gonna grab some sleep. I'll give you a holler when I'm up.

34560:
Okay, I'm back to work.

35040:
Yeah, I'll echo that.

35520:
Need to get this fixed.

36000:
Oh baby! We got a live one here.

36480:
I wouldn't be going anywhere near that.

36960:
One... more minute... That's as long as I can tread...

37440:
I'm here. Need instruction.

37920:
Looks like we finally got the laptop up and running.

38400:
Ouch! What did we hit?

38880:
Well... He's right. At least we're alive.

39360:
We should get going. Preferably, somewhere where there's a lot less snow.

39840:
I don't see any way out up here. We gotta figure out how to get that door open down below.

40320:
And just where would I go?

40800:
I can't believe I'm in the middle of a blizzard wearing a cruddy T-shirt. Somebody didn't do their job.

41280:
Ahhh! That's probably where all the soldiers are coming from.

41760:
It's kinda quaint around here, don't ya think?

42240:
I think I can actually feel heat running through my body.

42720:
I wish we could have all gotten through. Never know what lays ahead.

43200:
I don't think our entrance is going to be much of a surprise anymore.

43680:
Good! We're all here.

44160:
Betty must have a good business going. I don't see too much else around.

44640:
He could use a couple of seminars to brush up on his sales skills.

45120:
I've come a long way to get my sights on you!

45600:
I sure hope he knows what he's talking about.

46080:
The more the merrier, I always say.

46560:
Who knows, even I might pick up a pointer or two from you, Colonel.

47040:
Keep your eyes open, Mr. Kulba. Maybe you'll learn a thing or two.

47520:
Can't say I've seen any of the movies you've been in Tex, but if you're up to it, it's good to have you on the team.

48000:
This is new.

48480:
Not to be a party pooper, but are we really going to go through an industrial fan?

48960:
He should have known that was coming.

49440:
Can I take a look at the note?

49920:
A job well-executed. That place won't be a threat to Arulco anymore.

50400:
They must be coming from somewhere other than the border house. I bet we're dealing with the military now.

50880:
Holy moly! This gun's got to be a hundred years old.

51360:
All that's left is to clean up the mess.

51840:
What a loser! Hahahaha!

52320:
There's nothing left but tiny pieces, and that goes for whatever he had on him, too.

52800:
This always happens when you leave your wirecutters at home. Maybe it can be forced. Of course, the noise will probably echo throughout the entire building.

53280:
Look at the door... I don't think it was meant to open.

53760:
That moved something. I heard it.

54240:
I'm sure we didn't set that alarm off. Wonder what's up?

54720:
We're up. This is our chance to quietly get into the facility.

55200:
It's got all the instructions for firing the missiles; Point of origin, the coordinates for the towns in Arulco, everything. They were really ready to do it...

55680:
I wonder... If I punched in the point of origin on the control panel, if I could get a missile to destroy this place... It's worth a try. Just got to hit that elevator running when I'm done.
