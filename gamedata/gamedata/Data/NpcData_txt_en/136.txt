You have no idea how thankful we are. I am so honored to meet you!

480:
Remember me?

960:
Freedom! It is not something I believed I would see in my lifetime!

1440:
The Queen is dead at last! You may not believe this, but all of us wanted her dead! We feared her too much to rise against her. I hope you understand.

1920:
No, I could not possibly accept anything from you. It is me who should be giving YOU gifts!

2400:
Me? You want to talk to me? I don't know what to say! I am so grateful for everything you have done!

2880:
Oh, I understand. It is a great victory you have achieved today! Some time to relax, to understand, all that you have accomplished is what you need.

3360:
It's not for me.

3840:
Would you...help me?

4320:
You are heroes, and I am happy for this brief moment with you...

4800:
I shall never forget your kindness.

5280:
Wha... what? I... I don't understand!

5760:
You have more pressing matters...

6240:
There... There they are! Everyone! It's them!

6720:
Queen Deidranna! Never, never again! We never trusted her! Never liked her! Did we, huh! Did we! Better off dead and buried! Yeah!

7200:
And generous, too! Thank you!

7680:
And the creatures! You won't leave us alone with those... those disgusting things, will you? They'll kill us all!

8160:
Yah! Then your job will be over!
