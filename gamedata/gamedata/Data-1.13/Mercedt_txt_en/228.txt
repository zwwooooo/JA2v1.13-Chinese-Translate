I have spotted an enemy.

480:
I have the upper hand. The enemy fails to see me.

960:
I'm being attacked!

1440:
I have spotted an enemy.

1920:
I have spotted an enemy.

2400:
Son of a bitch!

2880:
This isn't good.

3360:
Be cautious. We must watch our step.

3840:
Be cautious. We must watch our step.

4320:
I am deeply confused. This was not part of my plans.

4800:
I'm being attacked!

5280:
I spotted something.

5760:
I have spotted something.

6240:
This isn't good. I could use some ammo.

6720:
Pulse... is weak... and erratic... I'm... losing... consciousness...

7200:
Needle's passing has left the world short an excellent physician. Enough said.

8640:
I'm confused.

9120:
This gun is going to get me killed! It won't fire!

9600:
They shall wish they had killed me!

10080:
I shall need to address my wounds.

10560:
Most fortunate.

11040:
It will be difficult to hit from here.

11520:
I shall need to address my wounds.

12000:
*yawn*

12480:
*sigh* I could sure use something to drink.

12960:
One less problem.

13440:
That was most satisfying.

15360:
Perhaps your sister could be of some assistance!

15840:
It appears you're in way over your head!

16800:
We are off to a fine start!

17280:
That would serve little purpose.

17760:
It pains me deeply to see you suffer this way! Perhaps you have overlooked the benefits of a nutritional breakfast!

18240:
I am most grateful for the possibility to place this matter... behind us.

18720:
Perhaps your sister could be of some assistance!

19200:
War... such a terrible necessity.

19680:
I did not come here to make... acquaintances. You will have to learn to manage a stable team.

20160:
Be cautious. We must watch our step.

20640:
It looks like we might have paid far more for the equipment than it is worth!

21120:
Bought it in Jersey. It's a hundred percent cotton!

21600:
War... such a terrible necessity.

22080:
We are halfway there, gentlemen!

22560:
It is most unfortunate. We have failed!

23040:
I do not care for this.

24480:
Needle is friend, and fine medical doctor!

25920:
For the moment, everything seems acceptable. However, I must allow others the opportunity to engage my services.

26400:
It appears you're in way over your head.

26880:
Son of a bitch!

27360:
I tried, but I haven't a clue what I'm doing!

27840:
That was most satisfying!

28320:
Be cautious! We must watch our step.

28800:
I doubt it will remain this quiet for too much longer!

29280:
Most fortunate!

29760:
That was most satisfying!

30240:
I spotted something!

30720:
It will be a routine operation.

31200:
We shall not hear from them anymore.

31680:
Son of a bitch!

32160:
That was most satisfying!

32640:
I have spotted an enemy.

33120:
We achieved our mission. You displayed the required composure to bring it all together. Well planned!

33600:
We shall not hear from them anymore.

34080:
*yawn*

34560:
For the moment, everything seems acceptable.

35040:
And the matter is no longer open to discussion!

35520:
This seems to be malfunctioning.

36000:
I'm not comfortable handling this!

36480:
I'm not comfortable handling this!

36960:
*glug glug* Too tired...to swim... *gasp* Need help... now...

37440:
We are halfway there, gentlemen.

38400:
No. The way you manage your team, that would serve little purpose.

38880:
Sorry, but I like to get to know my patients. The way you manage your team, nobody seems to stay around for very long!

39360:
A longtime patient of mine has taken a turn for the worse. I'll have to leave.

39840:
Unfortunately, I haven't managed to free up any time quite yet.

40320:
Searching for medical services? Let me introduce myself. I'm Doc Koolhan, the affordable and dependable licensed medical combat practitioner.

40800:
My patience has expired. I shall be leaving!

42720:
We haven't much time.

43200:
Your offer is accepted.

43680:
We are off to a fine start. You were my first choice of employer, and your offer is accepted.

44160:
I shall put my differences with you and your history aside, simply because Needle is a competent physician and a pleasure to work with.

45600:
For the moment, everything seems acceptable. However, I must allow others the opportunity to engage my services.

46080:
I shall repeat...

46560:
I am deeply insulted by your frail attempt at bribery, and I do not wish to hear another!

47040:
I have allowed you ample opportunity to secure my services. You failed to take advantage of it, and now my patience has expired.

47520:
Sorry, but I like to get to know my patients. The way you manage your team, nobody seems to stay around for very long!

49440:
I shall put my differences with you and your history aside, simply because Needle is a competent physician and a pleasure to work with.

50880:
I shall repeat...

51360:
I am deeply insulted by your frail attempt at bribery, and I do not wish to hear another!

51840:
I'm Doc Koolhan.

52320:
...the affordable and dependable licensed medical combat practitioner.

52800:
Searching for medical services?

53280:
The question of payment comes to mind. Specifically, how.

53760:
I'll have to leave.

55200:
Unfortunately, I haven't manage to free up any time quite yet. I'm kind of tied up at the moment.

55680:
One would think my medical abilities alone would warrant a more... persuasive offer.
