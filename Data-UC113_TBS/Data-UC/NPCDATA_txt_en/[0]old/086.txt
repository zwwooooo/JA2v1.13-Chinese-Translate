Peter Klaus. The pleasure is mine. Call me Kingpin if you wish, I feel we may have met before. I'm sure I recognise you.

480:
I trust you are enjoying our facilities. Please, visit the casino or theatre.

960:
I am a busy man, so please, get to the point of your visit.

1440:
My time is limited. There are various urgent matters requiring my attention, so please state your business.

1920:
Your gift is touching, though I hardly need such an item. A certain newspaper editor with two broken legs would be a more practical gesture. Hearse for Hearse, it has a pleasant ring to it.

2400:
Port Kip is a town requiring firm guidance. If we ever have unrigged elections, I'm certain the people would vote for me anyway.

2880:
Threatening my continued health and expected long life with a premature termination is hardly the way to ingratiate yourself into my good books.

3360:
Join you? What for, have you lost your senses?

3840:
Son-of-a-bitch... You're history.

4320:
It has been a pleasure. The exit is behind you to the left.

4800:
I will donate this to a deserving cause: The Kingpin Endowment. It's a charity involved with reforming wayward youth such as you find among the Satan's Sons gang.

You're messing with the wrong man...

I have considerable influence not only in this town but throughout much of Danubia. I am a generous man who has acquired the alliegance and services of many through my benevolence and interpersonal skills.

12480:
I have a proposition you may wish to consider. There is an item called a MOC list somewhere in this country. There is no need for you to be aware of it's signifigance or purpose.

12960:
I have contacts within the security and information gathering organizations of several countries who are willing to pay a great deal for the privilege of possessing this item.

13440:
I would reward you handsomely. My part is that of an intermediary. I arrange the acquisition, pay the acquirer, then pass it on to one of several interested third parties, depending on their offers.

13920:
I would have my own people attempt to find this item, but I can't risk Brenda discovering that I am in any way involved. The Crepaton organization also has an interest in this item for some reason.

14400:
Whether this is something that interests you or not is entirely up to you. But keep in mind during your travels that I will pay fifty thousand dollars, in cash, for the MOC List.

14880:
Let's get right to the point. Did you manage to find the MOC list or not? My contacts are becoming impatient.

15360:
Ah yes, I see you are most resourceful. It is indeed the MOC list. Congratulations!

15840:
And this, my dear friend is for you. Errr... By chance you wouldn't be looking for further work would you? I need a newspaper editors legs broken. Oh... It's all right, enjoy your well-earned money then.
