Visual contact.

480:
The enemy's here.

960:
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1440:
Heads up, we got a pukazoid.

1920:
Are those real? God, they are! They're like something out of a B-horror movie.

2400:
Looks like the pukazoids had a party.

2880:
Heard something.

3360:
Ugh, maybe I should call those things Dungazoids.

3840:
I got a hunch we're about to step into something.

4320:
Every time I turn around, I expect one of those pukazoids to be waiting.

4800:
Call out the goddamned cavalry!

5280:
Is that worth checking out?

5760:
What's this?

6240:
Time for a resupply of lead.

6720:
I need Morphine... Demerol... something!

7200:
Ron, darling, we always knew this day would come. I'm glad it was you first, because... because I didn't want to leave you alone, the way I am now. Peace be with you, my love.

8160:
I'm sorry to have lost you, Donna. I feel like I hardly got to know you. I promise, you won't be forgotten.

8640:
Lost my train of thought.

9120:
Need to unjam this gun A.S.A.P.

9600:
I'm gettin' a lot of attention!

10080:
I better get combat pay for this. Oh, wait, I already am.

10560:
That sure gets the adrenaline surging.

11040:
I'd probably miss that one on my best day.

11520:
I'm losing blood.

12000:
I'm beat. Time to see what's playing on the ol' eyelid theatre.

12480:
Gotta stop... gotta breathe.

12960:
Problem solved.

13440:
That pukazoid's worm food.

15360:
Sorry, Mike. But you made a bad career choice.

15840:
I'd go easy on the details of the death when telling their mother.

16800:
Need something to do.

17280:
That's not going to happen.

17760:
I got you, my pretty... and your little dog, too.

18240:
The Queen is dead. Long live the rest of us.

18720:
That wiseass's breath could peel paint.

19200:
I wouldn't mind packing up and going home.

19680:
These guys are all lunatics and bottom-feeders.

20160:
Aerial bombardment!

20640:
Wonder how many box tops they sent in to get these supplies.

22080:
I'm getting the hang of this.

22560:
Is it just me, or is that utterly ridiculous?

23040:
Knock me over with a feather.

24480:
They don't get any better than Raider.

25440:
Way to go, Spiderwoman!

25920:
Too soon for me. Gotta see how things go.

26400:
What a weird turn of events. Mike's here.

26880:
Right in the eye! Good God, I'm blind.

27360:
I could do that forever and still get nowhere!

27840:
How do people live in a place like this and still keep their sanity?

28320:
Hostiles have been detected in the quadrant.

28800:
We haven't taken care of all of them. Something to keep in mind.

29760:
A fine weapon.

30240:
There he is! Grab that kid.

30720:
I don't think she's going to get too far with that, Miguel. We can help you out. The rules are going to be a little different now.

31200:
That's a wrap. We've secured the quadrant.

31680:
Did they think we weren't going to notice stuff missing?

32160:
Mommie dearest had that coming. I just didn't see any other way to do it.

32640:
Mother of God...

33120:
Good work! Yeah, I'm going to miss all this. Then again, maybe there's another gig just over the horizon. Let me know, okay?

33600:
Guess the hostiles ran off to regroup.

34080:
I'm going to commune with my pillow. Lots more productive after a few winks.

34560:
That did the trick. I'm working again.

35040:
I was just going to say that.

35520:
Not good. Got an equipment failure here.

36000:
Call in explosives. It's rigged.

36480:
Careful, keep your focus to the ground. Probably meant for us.

36960:
<glub> Help! Anyone! Help... Ron...

37440:
I'm here. Always loved to travel.

38400:
I don't think so. I've read about you and your exploits.

38880:
Can't sign with you. I've grown fond of breathing.

39360:
Sorry. Can't find a sitter for the puppies.

39840:
Sorry, I'm going to a gun show. Give me some notice next time.

40320:
Hi, this is Charlene Higgens. You can leave me a message, or if you have my pager number, you can beep me.

40800:
Pleasure working with you. Like to use you as a reference, if you don't mind.

42720:
My contract's about up for renewal. I'm interested, if you are.

43200:
Good. I like this arrangement.

43680:
Done. I'm sure it'll be fun.

44160:
If my husband will work for you, so will I. Let's do it.

45120:
Well, I'd be frankly a little disinclined if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Houston, Spider that is, is on the team. She's great. So, I'm willing.

45600:
I just want to put this whole experience behind me.

46080:
I'm sorry. I said...

46560:
I understand your bank account is, how do I put this politely, insufficient.

47040:
Que sera sera. Lucky for you, I don't take these things personally.

47520:
Can't sign with you, I've grown fond of breathing.

49440:
If my husband will work for you, so will I. Let's do it.

50400:
Well, I'd be frankly a little disinclined if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Houston, Spider that is, is on the team. She's great. So, I'm willing.

50880:
I'm sorry. I said...

51360:
I understand your bank account is, how do I put this politely, insufficient.

51840:
Charlene Higgens.

52320:
I'm especially fond of night ops, if you anticipate a strong need in that area.

52800:
Can we hurry this up? I have some calls to make.

53280:
How long a contract do you want to arrange?

53760:
When you know what you want, give me a call.

55200:
Keep in mind that my commitment is coming to a close here.

55680:
I'm really moving up! Figured my pay should reflect that.
