Traitors!

480:
Have action here!

960:
This is dilemma!

1440:
Borscht!

1920:
Christ in Kremlin! Now I face them! Can this be real?

2400:
Had I been here, I would not have let this happen.

2880:
A noise! A suspicious noise.

3360:
Grandma's borscht? No, it cannot be.

3840:
I anticipate danger. I am ready.

4320:
Trouble is near... I know it.

4800:
I do not know fear.

5280:
I find something.

5760:
Interesting...

6240:
I need reload!

6720:
Ah... my name is spelled P-A-L-K-O-V, and I am diabetic in case doctor... must know.

7200:


7680:


8160:
Poor Ivan, mother Russia was better for you. You did her proud. I will fight this day for your honor.

8640:
Ah, a bad memory. I lost my concentration.

9120:
My weapon is not functioning.

9600:
They are just trying to scare me without success.

10080:
In Russia, we call that foreplay.

10560:
I felt a breeze.

11040:
I cannot see it from here.

11520:
I am shedding my blood!

12000:
I am requiring a sleep.

12480:
Urgent, let me catch my breath.

12960:
I win this one!

13440:
The monster is mash potatoes.

13920:


14400:


14880:
Why make me work with an idiot like Fidel! He is no good, and I wish him to be removed from my presence.

15360:
All right you fool, you have made your decision. Fidel stays, I go.

15840:
Inside I am warm and fuzzy.

16320:


16800:
Job complete. Next?

17280:
I do not feel it necessary.

17760:
So we meet again, Deidranna, and all too fitting that it would be me to bring you to your death. You may have hired me, but in good conscience, I could not continue.

18240:
Die, you mother of borscht!

18720:
What an imbicile.

19200:
Should have shot Deidranna when I had chance. But, no, and look now what we must go through.

19680:
Why can't more people be like me? Hm?

20160:
Overhead!

20640:
Junk! A soldier of my quality should have better equipment. Clearly, this is obvious to everyone.

21120:


21600:


22080:
I am improving.

22560:
Think this slower. I think you go too fast for self.

23040:
Drunk like skunk, I would not have done that.

23520:


24000:


24480:


24960:


25440:
Ivan, you are the pride of Mother Russia.

25920:
Perhaps there is an error in processing? I do not see pay yet.

26400:
Ungrateful infidels! Many would pay dearly for my service, so I shall seek them out instead.

26880:
Aghh! It is with much pain that I cannot see!

27360:
My opinion is, it is not possible.

27840:
Clearly, she liked me.

28320:
Traitors in the area!

28800:
We must remain on guard. The traitors are still near.

29280:


29760:
The party is over!

30240:
The teen boy! I will give him stern lecture.

30720:
Most unexpected. I had changed allegiance for you, and this what I get? Most unexpected.

31200:
All traitors lay in their blood without movement.

31680:
We are not the first to open this... Others have made claim to our things.

32160:
I hated this woman even when I was on other side. She is someone nobody could like. Yet... I like her now.

32640:
Siberia!

33120:
For this opportunity, for this success, I owe you congratulations and praise.

33600:
The traitors have moved out of territory.

34080:
It is urgent that I sleep.

34560:
I am presently working.

35040:
Me too!

35520:
I am tiring of this junk equipment.

36000:
Oooh... it is dangerous!

36480:
There lies traces of danger.

36960:
Ur...gent... the currents... they... pull... me... un <glub> der...

37440:
My arrival has happened.

37920:
