0:
More scum!

480:
Okay, let's pop some zits.

960:
Got my butt in a sling here!

1440:
Boogiebug in the vicinity.

1920:
God, I used to think somethin' like that lived underneath my bed. We called it, "the boogieman."

2400:
Lookit this mess. Must've been left by one of them boogiebugs.

2880:
I heard a funny noise.

3360:
Christ-mas, that's foul.

3840:
Gettin' goosebumps. Usually happens before all hell breaks loose.

4320:
Gotta keep an eye out for those boogiebugs.

4800:
The boogies are nailin' me!

5280:
Check that.

5760:
Someone dropped something.

6240:
This baby needs ammunition.

6720:
I ain't dead yet, but that's about the only good news I got.

7200:


7680:


8160:


8640:
Gimme that again. I got turned around a bit.

9120:
This gun picked a fine time to jam up.

9600:
Good time for a grenade.

10080:
Aah, playground stuff.

10560:
Good thing I ain't afraid to die.

11040:
That shot don't look good from here.

11520:
I got a rare blood type, so I better stop bleedin' soon.

12000:
I'm ready to drop. I should catch a few winks.

12480:
Need a minute...to get my breath back.

12960:
Ashes to ashes!

13440:
Back to hell.

13920:


14400:


14880:


15360:
Ahh...Doodlehead! Haha...

15840:
Euh, takes a helluva lot to make me puke, but that's just about my limit.

16320:
Trust me, the next time I see snow it better be Christmas.

16800:
Squared away. Find me somethin' else.

17280:
I don't feel much like it.

17760:
Wasn't nothin'. Though, I'd love to do it again.

18240:
Yee-haw! That sure beat steppin' on it.

18720:
What a wampass.

19200:
I'd rather be sellin' cookies door-to-door than puttin' up with this crap.

19680:
I dunno what rock these guys crawled out from under, but most of 'em creep me out.

20160:
The bastards're flyin' in low!

20640:
This equipment and a buck wouldn't get ya a cup of coffee.

21120:
My boobs feel like I'm in the frozen food section.

21600:


22080:
I'm gettin' the knack.

22560:
And where's the brains of this outfit?

23040:
What the hell did we THINK was gonna happen? A miracle?

23520:


24000:


24480:


24960:


25440:


25920:
Maybe we got the attention of the military.

26400:
Aww... he doesn't look so good.

26880:
I got sprayed in the eyes. Everything's a blur.

27360:
I could spend my life trying to get this.

27840:
What a character.

28320:
We know there's enemies present. Let's see if we can flush them out.

28800:
They're still around...somewhere. Let's not get cocky.

29280:
Fine piece of work.

29760:
I just love this weapon.

30240:
He looks like momma's boy. Let's grab him.

30720:
She'll be wishing she went to beauty school when I get through with her.

31200:
Yeah, baby. That's the last of this group of losers.

31680:
How's about someone cough up the missing stuff before I start snapping heads?

32160:
Bitch. Lie still. Mind you, if she gets up, I want to shoot her again. Best thing I've done all day.

32640:
Holy litterbox!

33120:
Right on. I knew we'd see this day. I enjoyed it, too. I like this quickie, getting in and out a whole country. Thanks again, for the experience.

33600:
Aw, looks like the poor widdle babies got scared and ran away. Just us here now.

34080:
I'm gonna crash for a sec. Let you know when I get back on the job.

34560:
I'm up and on it.

35040:
Hey, I said it first.

35520:
This is broken, doubt it's even worth holding.

36000:
Whoa! This baby's ready to do some damage.

36480:
I wouldn't walk near there even if it was the only way to the outhouse.

36960:
Drowning! Holy shit! Gotta get... <glub> outta here!

37440:
So tell me, what's the plan now that I'm here?

37920:


38400:
I don't feel much like in your group of losers.

38880:
I'd rather be sellin' cookies door-to-door than getting a burial like no other.

39360:
I'd rather be sellin' cookies door-to-door than puttin' up with this crap.

39840:
Why do I get the feeling that one of us is gonna have to play babysitter?

40320:
The next time I can't wait to try it out.

40800:
I enjoyed it. Thanks for the experience.

41280:


41760:


42240:


42720:
I sure hope we don't come up short later on.

43200:
Right on! Should we move on?

43680:
Right on! From here on in, we're stuck with each other.

44160:


44640:


45120:


45600:
I don't feel much like it.

46080:
Okay. Again...

46560:
Your bucks wouldn't get ya a cup of coffee.

47040:
Would that be right, then?

47520:
I'd rather be sellin' cookies door-to-door than getting a burial like no other.

48000:


48480:


48960:


49440:


49920:


50400:


50880:
Okay. Again...

51360:
Your bucks wouldn't get ya a cup of coffee.

51840:
So tell me, what's the plan now that I'm here?

52320:
Let's get moving already.

52800:
Should we move on?

53280:
Let's bring the battle to them for a change.

53760:
This isn't going anywhere.

54240:


54720:


55200:
I sure hope we don't come up short later on.

55680:
Something tells me our trails just got a little happier.

56160:
