0:
I think I see someone.

480:
I think I see an enemy. I might be able to shoot him from here.

960:
I'm in hot water here!

1440:
If I stay quiet, I could surprise him.

1920:
My eyes are playing tricks on me!

2400:
I got to do something about this. It's been happening way too often lately.

2880:
I hope it doesn't mean what I think it means.

3360:
This area smells of trouble.

I get nervous when there's no action.

This area is a little unnerving.

I'm in hot water here!

5280:
I think I see something.

5760:
I better take good care of this.

6240:
Out of bullets. I need all the ammo I can get!

6720:
I didn't see it coming. They blindsided me. I can't hang on for ver long... Send help.

7200:
Carp has passed away. It would've been nice if someone could've played pipes in his honour.

8640:
Must have overlooked something.

9120:
As if my aim wasn't enough of a problem, now my gun's not firing!

9600:
I hear shots! They're coming awful close!

10080:
I can't go much further... without taking... a break.

Take my heart miss a couple of beats!

A chance is extremely slim.

11520:
I think I'm bleeding.

12000:
I could use a rest.

12480:
I can't go much further...

12960:
Farewell!

13440:
We got one!

13920:
The Fox is nothing but trouble. Either you ship her out of here, or I'm shipping myself out.

15360:
I was hoping for more.

15840:
Your mother was a cheap date!

16800:
We've done it.

17280:
It is not possible!

17760:
This mission's over!

18240:
I have a feeling that was the last of them.

18720:
You've been warned.

19200:
There's far too many mercenaries dying down there.

19680:
I don't think you're capable of pulling off a succesful mission.

20160:
We have run into major snag!

20640:
Zis thing seems to be broken.

21120:
Women have no business being in combat!

21600:
I'm sure I can help you out - but I hope you realize my aim has been a little off lately.

22080:
I want to make sure you haven't overlooked my inconceivably strong mechanical skills.

22560:
We have run into major snag!

23040:
You have established a reputation for failure.

23520:
Women have no place in the military. Especially Fox. She's causing nothing but problems. I am leaving!

24480:
It will be great! My old chess buddy Carp signed on with you.

25920:
I've listened to your pity attempts at working things out far more times than I care to remember.

26400:
This guy could only stand still, I could finish him off.

26880:
I've been having some difficulties with my eyes.

27360:
I can't pry it.

27840:
You sure smell nice.

28320:
Are you scared?

28800:
Where did everybody go?

29760:
I'm half blind, and we're still creaming you!

30240:
I'm sure I can help you out.

30720:
This is a treatment I get for having a minor handicap?

31200:
I don't believe there's anyone left in that group!

31680:
Saying we paid too much would be an understatement.

32160:
It'll do.

32640:
Yikes!

33120:
We put in a good mission!

33600:
Just where did you do your training?

34080:
Things have been pretty slow lately.

34560:
I shall be working for you.

35040:
I believe I've mentioned that.

35520:
Zis thing seems to be broken.

36000:
There's something suspicious about it.

36480:
There's something suspicious about it.

36960:
Help me! I'm going underwater!

37440:
We should get going.
