0:
Enemy detected.

480:
I do believe we are finally going to see some battle.

960:
Assistance would be welcome.

1440:
Located a menace.

1920:
Burnt biscuits! How can such a beast exist? I would never accept such a a tale if I was not to lay eyes upon it myself.

2400:
Truly ferocious, they are.

2880:
I hope that sound wasn't what I think it was.

3360:
<sniff> Oh...my, that would chase a dog.

3840:
I am experiencing queasiness. A premonition of trouble.

4320:
I shall keep my guard around here. I sense those beasts are close by.

4800:
They sure are determined.

5280:
I see something.

5760:
Uncovered an item.

6240:
Require reloading.

6720:
I am slipping into shock... not going to survive.

7200:
Sidney was killed? He was always so cautious...I shall miss him terribly.

8640:
Request a reissue of orders.

9120:
Firearm malfunction!

9600:
I am being fired upon.

10080:
That was more painful than anyone can appreciate.

10560:
Luck was with me.

11040:
Are you quite sure you want me to try to hit that target from here?

11520:
I require medical aid.

12000:
It has been an exhausting shift. I'm feeling rather pooped.

12480:
I am tuckered out.

12960:
Cheerio!

13440:
They're revolting...

15360:
Forgive me, Mike. I was left without a choice, and that was of your own making.

15840:
Ewwhh... I would have preferred not to have seen that.

16800:
Awaiting new orders.

17280:
I do not have the motivation to carry out that order.

17760:
I never believed a woman capable of such evil. She will no longer sully our reputation.

18240:
Finally, what a relief!

18720:
In the words of Magic, "Quite the Snapperhead."

19200:
I should be at home spending time with the kids.

19680:
Some people have so little to offer. And they all seem to be gathered here.

20160:
I hear planes!

20640:
The equipment I have been assigned may have had a noble history. However, the time has come to make some new purchases.

21120:
If anybody needs any help with anything, just let me know.

21600:
I am not particularly proud to admit this, but the French irritate me to no avail. Especially, Parisians.

22080:
I believed I was making progress.

22560:
Precisely what would be the purpose?

23040:
Rather predictable, I would say.

24480:
I can always count on Sidney.

25920:
For the moment, I would like to take a wait-and-see approach.

26400:
Why, this is difficult to believe. Mike is working for her?

26880:
Biscuits! I've been blinded.

27360:
I should probably stop trying.

27840:
Rather pleasant, wouldn't you say?

28320:
Enemies are known to be in the vicinity, sir.

28800:
They most likely took shelter under the rock they crawled out from under.

29280:
I could most certainly make use of this.

30240:
I believe that is the Graham boy. With our help, perhaps his mother will finally get some sleep.

30720:
It is indeed terrible, Miguel, but it is also by no means over. You shall enjoy the benefits of our full support.

31200:
Good work! That's the last of them.

31680:
Hmm. Our order has not been processed completely. I expect this will be corrected. Unless, of course, someone has been skimming off the top.

32160:
Terrible. But she did bring this upon herself. Can't feel poorly for that, then, now can we?

32640:
Ferocious feline!

33120:
Cheers! Rather pleasant, isn't it? To know we made a difference in the lives of so many people. That's what this is all about, then. Congratulations all around!

33600:
The enemies have withdrawn. I believe we're at ease for a while.

34080:
I shall take a short rest. I don't feel I'm doing my best, now.

34560:
Ah, much, much better. I shall get back to work, then.

35040:
Ditto that!

35520:
This is hardly worthwhile. It is not even functioning.

36000:
Hmm. There's more to this than meets the eye.

36480:
Exercise caution. We may be in jeopardy.

36960:
Bloody biscuits! My children... help... say goodbye!

37440:
Reporting in from new position, Commander.

38400:
I regret, Commander, that your reputation is... to be blunt, poor. Perhaps with time, you will be able to correct that, and I shall be in a position to accept your proposition.

38880:
Sorry, but the casualty rate, in my opinion, reflects a carelessness on your part, Commander.

39360:
Unfortunately, I will not be able to oblige. I have made promises to my children which I intend to keep.

39840:
I wish you had not left it to the last moment. I wasn't aware of your intentions, Commander. So, I made other commitments.

40320:
Hello. You have reached the residence and office of Scope Sterling. I regret that I am unable to answer at this moment. If you'd be so kind as to leave a message, I shall return your call as quickly as possible.

40800:
I hope you found my services up to snuff, Commander. Best of Luck.

42720:
Pardon me, Commander, but have you given any thought as to whether I shall remain in Arulco?

43200:
Continuing my employment with you shall be a pleasure, Commander.

43680:
Most satisfactory, Commander.

44160:
I'd never allow the opportunity to work with Sidney to slip me by. I shall put my misgivings about you aside.

45600:
Sorry, Commander but childbirth was more pleasant.

46080:
Pardon me. I said...

46560:
Evidently, your financial situation does not place you in a position to be offering me a contract.

47040:
Must say, I am slightly surprised, Commander. However, I did appreciate the opportunity.

47520:
Sorry, but the casualty rate, in my opinion, reflects a carelessness on your part, Commander.

49440:
I'd never allow the opportunity to work with Sidney to slip me by. I shall put my misgivings about you aside.

50880:
Pardon me. I said...

51360:
Evidently, your financial situation does not place you in a position to be offering me a contract.

51840:
Hello. You have the attention of Scope Sterling.

52320:
Tragic about Diana, wasn't it?

52800:
Is this going to be much longer?

53280:
What duration were you considering?

53760:
My apologies, but I cannot remain here indefinitely.

55200:
Pardon the intrusion, but the contract for my employ is approaching its conclusion.

55680:
I am well versed in military operations, and my skills continue to improve. It is only right and proper for me, at this time, to increase the cost of my services.
