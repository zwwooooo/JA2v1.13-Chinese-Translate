L"\n \nThis weapon modifies the shooter's ability to\naccurately apply counter-force against its\nrecoil, due to its attachments, ammo, or inherent abilities.\n \nNaturally, this has no effect if the weapon lacks\nboth Burst and Auto-Fire modes.\n \nA high bonus helps the shooter bring the gun's muzzle\nprecisely towards the target, even at longer ranges,\nmaking volleys more accurate as a result.\n \nHigher is better.",
L"\n \nThis weapon modifies the shooter's ability to\nfrequently reasses how much counter-force they\nneed to apply against a gun's recoil, due to its\nattachments, ammo, or inherent abilities.\n \nNaturally, this has no effect if the weapon lacks\nboth Burst and Auto-Fire modes.\n \nHigher frequency makes volleys more accurate on the whole,\nand also makes longer volleys more accurate assuming\nthe shooter can overcome recoil correctly.\n \nHigher is better.",
L"\n \nWhen held in hand, this weapon modifies the amount of\nAPs its user gets at the start of each turn.\n \nHigher is better.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthe AP cost to bring this weapon to 'Ready' mode has\nbeen modified.\n \nLower is better.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthe AP cost to make a single attack with this\nweapon has been modified.\n \nNote that for Burst/Auto-capable weapons, the\ncost of using these modes is directly influenced\nby this modifier as well!\n \nLower is better.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthe AP cost to fire a Burst with this weapon has\nbeen modified.\n \nNaturally, this has no effect if the weapon is not\ncapable of Burst fire.\n \nLower is better.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthe AP cost to fire an Autofire Volley with this weapon\nhas been modified.\n \nNaturally, this has no effect if the weapon is not\ncapable of Auto Fire.\n \nNote that it does NOT modify the extra AP\ncost for adding bullets to the volley, only\nthe initial cost for starting the volley.\n \nLower is better.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthe AP cost of reloading this weapon has been modified.\n \nLower is better.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthe size of magazines that can be loaded into this\nweapon has been modified.\n \nThe weapon will now accept larger or smaller\nmagazines of the same caliber.\n \nHigher is better.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthe amount of bullets fired by this weapon in Burst mode\nhas been modified.\n \nIf the weapon was not initially Burst-Capable, and the\nmodifier is positive, then this is what\ngives the weapon its burst-fire capability.\n \nConversely, if the weapon was initially Burst-Capable,\na high-enough negative modifier here may have\ndisabled burst mode entirely for this weapon.\n \nHigher is USUALLY better. Of course, part of the\npoint in Burst Mode is to conserve bullets...",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthis weapon produces no muzzle flash.\n \nThis makes sure that enemies cannot spot the shooter\nif he is firing while hidden, and is especially\nimportant at night.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthis weapon's loudness has been modified. The distance\nat which enemies and mercs can hear the weapon being\nused has subsequently changed.\n \nIf this modifier drops the weapon's Loudness value\nto 0, the weapon becomes completely silent.\n \nLower is better.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthis weapon's size category has changed.\n \nSize is important when using the New Inventory system,\nwhere pockets only accept items of specific sizes and shapes.\n \nIncreasing an item's size makes it too big for some pockets\nit used to fit into.\n \nConversely, making an item smaller means it will fit into\nmore pockets, and pockets will be able to contain\nmore of it.\n \nLower is generall better.",
L"\n \nDue to its attachments, ammo or inherent abilities,\nthis weapon's reliability has been modified.\n \nIf positive, the weapon's condition will deteriorate\nslower when used in combat. Otherwise, the\nweapon deteriorates faster.\n \nHigher is better.",
L"\n \nWhen this weapon is held in hand, it modifies the\nsoldier's camouflage in woodland backgrounds.\n \nTo make good on a positive Woodland Camo modifier, the\nwearer needs to stay close to trees or tall grass.\n \nHigher is better.",
L"\n \nWhen this weapon is held in hand, it modifies the\nsoldier's camouflage in urban backgrounds.\n \nTo make good on a positive Urban Camo modifier, the\nwearer needs to stay close to asphalt or concrete.\n \nHigher is better.",
