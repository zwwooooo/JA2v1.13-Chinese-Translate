0:
这儿有敌人。

480:
他们在这里，好戏开演啦。

960:
我希望在我还能走动的时候离开这地方！

1440:
这里有一只吃人虫！

1920:
天！这虫子怎么说也有千年道行了！

2400:
我觉得有一只吃了壮大灵的虫子来过这里。

2880:
听到了?

3360:
希望刚才是有人放臭屁了。否则，我们就是在一个狂暴的大虫子的下风处。

3840:
我觉得这儿有危险。

4320:
狮子、老虎和大虫子……噢，我的天，这个国家什么东西都全了。

4800:
从我面前滚开！臭异形！我早带些杀虫剂就好了！

5280:
瞧那边。

5760:
那儿有什么？

6240:
弹匣空了。

6720:
我没知觉了……可能要先走一步了。

8640:
等一下，我迷糊了，我们要去做什么？

9120:
这该死的枪卡住了。

9600:
如果我不离开这儿，我就成烤鹅了。

10080:
谢谢你，非常感谢。

10560:
呃……这样就很刺激了，被打中就不好了。

11040:
在这儿没机会打中，也许别的地方可以。

11520:
如果我一直流血不止，早晚会晕掉的。

12000:
我太困了，我必须睡一会儿。

12480:
我喘不过气来了，让我歇一下。

12960:
你死了，白痴。

13440:
我搓了你个大跳虫！

15840:
我下周不会有食欲了。

16800:
准备好了接受新任务。

17280:
不，我拒绝。

17760:
我宁可看她痛苦的时间长一点儿，但是，嘿，这样也行。

18240:
Yeah，宝贝！你的死状太酷了！

18720:
我知道那个白痴的问题在哪----没有吸够二手烟。

19200:
下次，我得做点更令人兴奋的事情……例如在布鲁克林射杀地铁老鼠。

19680:
Jesus,我希望没有集体照片，我不想被看到和这些低等的家伙们在一起。

20160:
上帝啊！它们正(俯冲)扫射！

20640:
再好的胶带也粘不好这些烂货了！

22080:
我是自学成才！

22560:
非常糟糕的计划。

23040:
今年的金火鸡奖授予我们的……

26400:
脚踩实地的感觉真好，现在去找那反抗军领袖Miguel吧。

26880:
上帝啊！我睁不开眼了。

27360:
没结果的，别试了。

27840:
一个好伙计。

28320:
仔细巡视，周围有侵略者。

28800:
我们还没有把敌人全部解决，所以都小心点。

29280:
这可是难得一遇的好枪。

30240:
那个小孩看起来好象在躲什么人一样。

30720:
这些客套免了吧。我们接手你的工作，事情会有转机的。

31200:
太好了！消灭干净了！没有一个垃圾留下。

31680:
等一下，好象我们遇到点问题了，我们的货到哪儿去了？

32160:
感觉怎么样，亲爱的？告诉你吧，我感觉好极了。这儿所有人都和我一样。

32640:
狗食！

33120:
没什么能比得上大家不畏艰险地并肩作战了。作为第一个参加者，我谢谢你们所有人。

33600:
噢，让它们逃走了，我讨厌这样。

34080:
睡一会儿吧，我醒来会喊你一声的。

34560:
OK，我又开始工作了。

35040:
是的，我也这样想。

35520:
需要把它弄好。

36000:
噢！宝贝！这里有个陷阱。

36480:
我可不想靠它太近。

36960:
还有……一分钟……那是我能坚持的时间。

37440:
我到这儿了，请指示。

37920:
Looks like we finally got the laptop up and running.

38400:
Ouch! What did we hit?

38880:
Well... He's right. At least we're alive.

39360:
We should get going. Preferably, somewhere where there's a lot less snow.

39840:
I don't see any way out up here. We gotta figure out how to get that door open down below.

40320:
And just where would I go?

40800:
I can't believe I'm in the middle of a blizzard wearing a cruddy T-shirt. Somebody didn't do their job.

41280:
Ahhh! That's probably where all the soldiers are coming from.

41760:
It's kinda quaint around here, don't ya think?

42240:
I think I can actually feel heat running through my body.

42720:
I wish we could have all gotten through. Never know what lays ahead.

43200:
I don't think our entrance is going to be much of a surprise anymore.

43680:
Good! We're all here.

44160:
Betty must have a good business going. I don't see too much else around.

44640:
He could use a couple of seminars to brush up on his sales skills.

45120:
I've come a long way to get my sights on you!

45600:
I sure hope he knows what he's talking about.

46080:
The more the merrier, I always say.

46560:
Who knows, even I might pick up a pointer or two from you, Colonel.

47040:
Keep your eyes open, Mr. Kulba. Maybe you'll learn a thing or two.

47520:
Can't say I've seen any of the movies you've been in Tex, but if you're up to it, it's good to have you on the team.

48000:
This is new.

48480:
Not to be a party pooper, but are we really going to go through an industrial fan?

48960:
He should have known that was coming.

49440:
Can I take a look at the note?

49920:
A job well-executed. That place won't be a threat to Arulco anymore.

50400:
They must be coming from somewhere other than the border house. I bet we're dealing with the military now.

50880:
Holy moly! This gun's got to be a hundred years old.

51360:
All that's left is to clean up the mess.

51840:
What a loser! Hahahaha!

52320:
There's nothing left but tiny pieces, and that goes for whatever he had on him, too.

52800:
This always happens when you leave your wirecutters at home. Maybe it can be forced. Of course, the noise will probably echo throughout the entire building.

53280:
Look at the door... I don't think it was meant to open.

53760:
That moved something. I heard it.

54240:
I'm sure we didn't set that alarm off. Wonder what's up?

54720:
We're up. This is our chance to quietly get into the facility.

55200:
It's got all the instructions for firing the missiles; Point of origin, the coordinates for the towns in Arulco, everything. They were really ready to do it...

55680:
I wonder... If I punched in the point of origin on the control panel, if I could get a missile to destroy this place... It's worth a try. Just got to hit that elevator running when I'm done.
