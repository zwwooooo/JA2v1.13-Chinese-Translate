It's nice to make your acquaintance.

480:
Remember me?

960:
I never thought I'd find myself in the middle of a war.

1440:
John's terrible when it comes to organizing vacations. I spent my honeymoon in Paris... Texas.

1920:
Sure... Thanks a lot, now.

2400:
I wanted to go to Disneyland in Orlando.

2880:
I'll do whatever you say.

3360:
Oh, John would never allow me to join.

3840:
Oh, my gosh... I'm bleeding John... John?

4320:
It was nice meeting you. I hope everything works out.

4800:
Oh, no, you keep it.

5280:
Well... that's not quite true, John.

5760:
John was crazy for trusting you.

6240:
I don't see the airport.

6720:
The sooner I see the airport the better.

7200:
My husband has no appreciation for history.

7680:
I have very mixed feelings about it. At least I'll see my grandchildren again, but they'll miss John. So will I. Oh, thank you nonetheless.

8160:
This is all the vacation money we have. But, I don't mind giving it to you in the least.

8640:
I just want to be in Cleveland. My mind is already there.

9120:
My husband is in pain.

9600:
Oh my God, John... John...

10080:
Oh, no... Oh, no...

10560:
Oh my! How can you even think about talking right now?

11040:
Finally. I thought you were going to leave me here forever.
