1920:
This is gonna be more fun than I thought!

Jackpot! The spawning grounds. Gonna nip this right in the butt right now!

Catchin' noise.

Step firmly! Got a bad feeling!

4800:
Ham-dog! I'm knee deep in it.

5280:
There!

5760:
What's that?

6240:
I'm dry! Need some ammo now.

6720:
Not good. Spraying blood like a keg.

7200:
Knowing Bull, he went hard.

7680:
Biff is dead? He was like a pet to me.

8160:
Gus was a good man.

8640:
Makes no sense...

9120:
Gun's jamming!

9600:
This ain't over.

10080:
Couple of drinks and I won't even remember it.

10560:
Losers.

11040:
Ain't doable. No visuals.

11520:
Got a low grade wound here.

12000:
Time to get into my bag. I'm beat...

12480:
Sucking... on a... lung.

12960:
Another one for the chaplain.

13440:
Reminds me of soup... I like soup.

13920:
Don't know what that Trevor's going on about. Couldn't give a kangaroos arse either. Just ditch him.

14400:
That Meltdown has gotta be the ugliest looking thing I ever saw. Got an urge to shoot it, myself.

15840:
He deserved to die slower, but what ya gonna do.

16800:
I'm finished up.

17280:
Hope you weren't counting on it.

17760:
Very nice! Looks like there's something to that big bang theory, after all. Well... That's what we came to do!

18240:
Very nice! Looks like there's something to that big bang theory, after all. Well... That's what we came to do!

18720:
Somebody's child...

19200:
This sucks eggs.

19680:
Posers. Poor imitations of fighting men that's what most of 'em are.

20160:
Stay alert! Bird droppings coming our way.

20640:
Most of my stuff should be ditched in a lake.

21120:
I like it when them snobs walk around with their noses way up in the air, gives me something to aim for.

22080:
Comes with performance.

22560:
Got a stupid tag hanging from it.

23040:
Step away. Ain't nothing to see here.

23520:
He keeps blabbing away in sort of kangaroo speak. Don't know, but I'm getting away from Colby. He's giving me a tumor.

24000:
I see that thing's face again, I swear I'm gonna die. I'm puttin' some mileage between me and Meltdown. I just can't bring up any more acid.

24480:
Bull knows the ropes.

24960:
That boy makes me piss myself.

25440:
There's a man with a couple of wars under his belt.

26880:
Eyeballs are tearing. That's never happened before.

27360:
Not proud to say this, but trying is useless.

27840:
That was entertaining.

28320:
We're gonna see action here.

28800:
They're not all bagged yet. Keep that in mind.

29760:
Makes me warm inside.

30240:
Somebody's child...

30720:
Now we're both happy.

31200:
It's looks just like they were never here.

31680:
Ham-dog! What the Hell happened?

32160:
Reminds me of the lady who ran the corner store back in my old neighborhood.

32640:
Got four-legged trouble.

33120:
I get mixed feelings when these things come to an end. Get some down time, but I can't really relax unless I got a finger tugging at a trigger. Hopefully, we'll get to do it again.

33600:
Someone musta yelled fire. They made for the exits.

35040:
Count me in, too.

35520:
Fraggin' piece of ham-dog this thing!

36000:
It ain't clean. Should be careful.

36480:
Don't look right around here.

37440:
I'm standing by. Want to change that?

37920:
Computer's back in business. Can't wait to fire up a couple of my... favorite sites.

38400:
Ham-dog! What the Hell happened?

38880:
Yeah... And you'll be lucky if I let you live.

39360:
We showed up like the fourth of July. We should be making tracks.

39840:
We ain't going anywhere up here. Gotta figure a way to open that freakin' door downstairs.

40320:
Yeah... right! There's only one way out and we're going together.

40800:
Had I known we were landing in the Arctic, I would have worn my long underwear. Ham-dog! I'm freezing!

41280:
Jackpot! The spawning grounds. Gonna nip this right in the butt right now!

41760:
Grew up in a town pretty much like this...

42240:
Well, there's a good sign, my pants are filling out again. Amazing what a little bit of sun'll do.

42720:
Looks like we didn't all make it! Oh, well...

43200:
We made a lot of noise, but that's the way I like it. Gives 'em time to think about what's coming.

43680:
Looks like we didn't lose anyone to the blades.

44160:
Reminds me of the lady who ran the corner store back in my old neighborhood.

44640:
Got a loud bark for a little dog.

45120:
This is gonna be more fun than I thought!

45600:
Kid seems up-front. I trust him.

46080:
I never made it to Arulco, Manuel, but I'll do my best to see ya get back there.

46560:
Keep in check there, Colonel. Sometimes the less said the better.

47040:
Something tells me I'm gonna enjoy having you around, Kulba.

47520:
Just remember this ain't the movies, Cowboy!

48000:
Ham-dog! A new weapon to check out.

48480:
Ya know, if that buzzsaw starts up when we're in there, we're history.

48960:
He deserved to die slower, but what ya gonna do.

49440:
Gimme that paper!

49920:
Very nice! Looks like there's something to that big bang theory, after all. Well... That's what we came to do!

50400:
Looks like we didn't nip them in the butt after all. Whole country must know we're here!

50880:
Hummm. An eighteen century hand mortar with ammo. Haven't since one of those in over a month.

51360:
That's the last of 'em. What makes me think the hag's gonna be selling rugs in a month from now?

51840:
Thought I'd seen everything. Guess explosives weren't his speciality.

52320:
Only downside is raging Raul destroyed everything he was carrying, too.

52800:
Wirecutters would have been nice. Now, we gotta give this thing a good boot and let everyone know we're coming.

53280:
Look at the door. Ya gotta know someone doesn't want us in there.

53760:
I heard a loud noise coming from downstairs.

54240:
What's the deal with that alarm. Did we trigger something?

54720:
That's our cue. Fan is shutdown.

55200:
It's a list of launch coordinates for the missiles. Gives me an idea... I say, I fire off one of these suckers myself. Never had the pleasure before.

55680:
Shot it straight up and bring her straight back down. I'll program the coordinates for this place into control panel and scoot out by the elevator. Sounds like a plan to me.
