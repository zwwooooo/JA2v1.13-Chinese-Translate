0:
Red alert!

480:
Awww...no. I was just beginning to get comfortable.

960:
Oh my God! I'm a dead man.

1440:
Holy Cropus! It's one of those things.

1920:
Oh my God! Let's hope they're friendly.

2400:
Sure glad it wasn't me.

2880:
What was that?

3360:
Smells like Bubba.

3840:
I know there's going to be trouble... There's always trouble.

4320:
I sure hope we don't see one of those things!

4800:
Oh my God! Oh my God!

5280:
Over there.

5760:
Something there.

6240:
Bullets! Bullets! BULLETS!

6720:
Oh my God! This is so painful.

7200:
Oh my, not you, Larry. You had come so far... washed away all your demons. I can't believe it. Oh my...

8160:
This is terrible! Flo, you were so French. You were my wallflower. If I wasn't so terrified of dying next, I'd write you a poem.

8640:
I think I'm lost!

9120:
I'm gonna die.

9600:
I'm so scared...

10080:
I'm gonna have to change my underwear.

10560:
Whew! I...I was never worried. He he.

11040:
I'm a lot better, but I don't think I can make that.

11520:
Oh my God! That's my blood.

12000:
I need a nice warm bed.

12480:
This mercenary life is really exhausting.

12960:
I did that.

13440:
I turned that thing's lights out.

13920:
There's no fooling me. Larry's back on the stuff again. He's a wreck, and I really don't want to have to work with him.

15840:
Oh my God! I think I got brain on me!

16320:
I've got to stop biting my nails, or I'm not going to have any fingers left.

16800:
Another job taken care of.

17280:
I'll just pretend I didn't hear that.

17760:
She kinda reminds me of my mother, but my mother's still alive.

18240:
I did it! I did it for every son that ever wanted to do that!

18720:
That clown makes me nervous.

19200:
I'm feeling kinda homesick.

19680:
There's too many of those AIM elitist guys here. The More Economic Recruitment Center offers much better value.

20160:
MAYDAY! MAYDAY! They're attacking from the sky.

20640:
Why do I always get all the crappy stuff?

21120:
Sometimes I wish I never left my room.

22080:
That'll show 'em.

22560:
I bet that's never been tried before.

23040:
Who would have guessed that would happen?

23520:
I really believed Larry was on the right track, but he's just like my mother. They'll never get rid of their demons. I can't be part of it anymore. I have to leave.

24480:
Wow, Larry! I told ya you could do it.

25440:
You're really something special, Flo.

25920:
My partner has informed me that you've fallen behind in your payments. He's also advised me to return to headquarters immediately. So, you'll have to fight this war without me. Good luck!

26880:
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my... I'm BLIND!

27360:
This isn't fair. It's impossible.

27840:
There's some rather nice people down here.

28320:
We know they're here. Let's hope they don't feel like fighting.

28800:
Let's be real careful. They're probably close-by, just waiting for the chance to kill us.

29280:
Oh, WOW... I hope they let me keep it.

30240:
There's that kid Joey. I'll take care of him.

30720:
It was something I said, wasn't it? Something someone else said? Well, I tried, and if you need me back, no hard feelings.

31200:
All clear... and I'm still alive!

31680:
Oh, I'm worried about this. It's not all here.

32160:
I'll be honest. She reminded me of my mother. She deserved what she got. Sometimes, there just isn't any other way.

32640:
BIG cat!

33120:
Yeah! Yeah! We did it! I knew we could! Oh sure, there were a few times when you thought I was scared, but I wasn't really scared. Right? Guys?

33600:
Oh, thank God. They've left the area.

34080:
I'm taking a little nap. I get a little anxious without regular rest.

34560:
Good morning. I'll get back to work now.

35040:
Oh, me too.

35520:
It's broke. Why does my stuff always break?

36000:
Oh no... I think it's booby trapped.

36480:
Uh oh. I don't want to go too close. Maybe we should just take the long way around.

36960:
Oh my God! I'm drowing! Some... one...!

37440:
Um, okay. I'm there... ah, here.
