0:
I have an enemy in sight!

480:
I have the advantage over this enemy!

960:
I am in battle! Cover fire could prove helpful.

1440:
Well, look at that.

1920:
I travelled all the way here for THIS?

2400:
I just hope for your sake, you're aware of implications.

2880:
I better be extremely alert around here.

3360:
I must have ate some bad food.

3840:
Everything seems too perfect. I better be extremely alert around here.

4320:
I better be extremely alert around here.

4800:
I am in battle! Cover fire could prove helpful.

5280:
I found something here.

5760:
I found something here.

6240:
I am short of ammunition!

6720:
I've got... multiple lacerations. I'm hemorrhaging. Diminshed sensation in my legs. My... my prognosis is poor.

8640:
I am slightly disoriented.

9120:
This gun better start working soon!

9600:
Shots fired in my direction!

10080:
I need to get some liquids into me.

10560:
I consider myself lucky.

11040:
I can't make that!

11520:
I have a laceration that requires minor suturing.

12000:
I'm getting a little fatigue.

12480:
This climate is doing a number on my system.

12960:
It's my kill!

13440:
It's my kill!

13920:
I've seen Raffi's supposed medical degree from Harvard. It was full of ink smudges, and "Harvard" was spelled with an "f".

15360:
That was easier than I thought.

15840:
Talk about trauma!

16320:
This climate is doing a number on my system.

16800:
I came through.

17280:
I refuse to comply!

17760:
It was in the first course - "Vultures 101" at med school - that we learnt all about people like you.

18240:
I can finally put this behind me.

18720:
There was a time, when I would've taken this personal. That was when I didn't know you!

19200:
Rest assured. We've learned from our mistakes.

19680:
I am extremely picky about team solidarity!

20160:
I am being attacked!

20640:
This doesn't seem to be working!

21120:
Have you forgotten? I wrote your prescription.

21600:
Doctors are not a dime a dozen, you know.

22080:
Your wisdom in hiring me has paid off!

22560:
You got some nerve.

23040:
Rest assured. We've learned from our mistakes.

23520:
Well look at that. It's "doctor" Raffi.

25920:
I don't care much for long flights. Think I'll stick around here and see what else comes up. If things get slow, I'll reconsider.

26400:
So! You think you're tough!

26880:
I am being attacked!

27360:
All I wanna know is whether you'd ask a mechanic to do a heart bypass!

27840:
I'll do my best to ensure your satisfaction.

28320:
Enemies in the vicinity!

28800:
That was just a taste!

29760:
You must have quite the triage facility set up, to handle such an enormous amount of casualities!

30240:
If you entrust me with it, this mission is as good as done!

30720:
We have an arrangement.

31200:
That was the final member of that platoon.

31680:
Though it's not my field of expertise, I can say without hesitation that we were been scourged by that arms dealer.

32160:
I'm making a note to not bother negotiating with you anymore.

32640:
Well, look at that.

33120:
I've ran into shorter and much more problematic assignments than this one. If everything remains the same - I'll rejoin you whenever you want me.

33600:
We've gained possesion of the sector!

34080:
For the time being, I think I'll stick around here.

34560:
Time is precious.

35040:
I'm sure you can top it.

35520:
This doesn't seem to be working!

36000:
It is hooked to explosives... It appears rather sophisticated.

36480:
I better be extremely alert around here.

36960:
I am submerging! I need help!

37440:
I came through.

38400:
I think it's safe to say you're wasting your time and your money asking me!

38880:
The chances of dying on your team are way too high. I'll wait for an offer that makes dying far less likely.

39360:
I've already worked for and had severe difficulties with you. There is no possibility of me ever rejoining.

39840:
It's simply isn't possible. I'm attending a conference on battle fatigue syndrome.

40320:
I'm attending a conference on battle fatigue syndrome. The conference continues - though I'm getting a little fatigue myself.

40800:
I've ran into shorter and much more problematic assignments than this one. If everything remains the same - I'll rejoin you whenever you want me.

41280:
I can't believe you bought Raffitto Leevon's story about being a doctor. I can't work with him!

42720:
I don't care much for long flights.

43200:
It's a long flight... I'm already here... I'll take it!

43680:
I'll do my best to ensure your satisfaction.

45600:
You got some nerve, thinking you can buy me off.

46080:
You might recall. I said...

46560:
It's not possible. You can't afford my services. You'll have to settle for a good nurse, a bad doctor... or a Raffi!

47040:
If you're looking for a bargain, you are talking to the wrong person.

47520:
I quit! There's a limit to the amount of death even a doctor can stomach! I'd say you've reached it.

48000:
I can't believe you swallowed Raffi's story about being a doctor. If you don't have the good sense to send him home, I'm resigning.

50880:
You might recall. I said...

51360:
You terms of payment - maybe you do, maybe you don't - trouble me. For the time being, I'm off to seek another assignment.

51840:
Forget the rest - go with the best! Doctor Mitch Shudlem, receipts supplied upon request.

52320:
I think it's important to develop a strong doctor-patient relationship.

52800:
What are you in? Some sort of low level consciousness?

53280:
I'll go, but to be frank - if there are better offers forthcoming, I reserve the right to change my mind.

53760:
Apparently, there aren't any offers at all. And, according to my notes, we won't be negotiating this matter.

54240:
So you think you're a physician, Raffi? Well, let's see how good you are at plugging your own holes.

55200:
We'll be out of time before I know it.

55680:
I better get the credit I deserve!
