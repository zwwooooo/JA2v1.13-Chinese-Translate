0:
这里有个混蛋！

480:
OK，让我挤爆这些“小痘痘”。

960:
我想闪人了！

1440:
发现“摇摆虫”！

1920:
天啊，我想这玩意很像一种住在我床底下的虫子，我们称之“摇摆人”。

2400:
看这乱的，一定是某只“摇摆虫”留下的。

2880:
我听到古怪的声音。

3360:
天！这太臭了！

3840:
起鸡皮了，这通常在危险时才发生。

4320:
注意留心那些“摇摆虫”。

4800:
“摇摆虫”盯上我了！

5280:
核对一下那东西。

5760:
有人掉东西了。

6240:
这宝贝需要弹药。

6720:
我还没死，我也只是还没死罢了。

8640:
再说一遍，我有点犯晕了。

9120:
这把枪真会挑时间卡壳。

9600:
用手榴弹的好机会。

10080:
啊哈，这点伤跟玩一样。

10560:
还好我不怕死。

11040:
从这射击看起来不太好。

11520:
我的血型很罕见，我最好快点止血。

12000:
我准快累到了，我该稍微合合眼。

12480:
等一下……让我喘口气。

12960:
尘归尘！

13440:
滚回地狱去吧。

15840:
我的忍耐力还是可以的，但这次也忍不住要吐出来了。

16800:
重新开始，给我其他事做做。

17280:
我不乐意。

17760:
这真是小菜一碟。不过，让我再杀她一次我也愿意。

18240:
呀哈！这比飚车还爽！

18720:
蠢货一个。

19200:
我宁愿挨家挨户卖陷饼，也不愿和这些废物在一起。

19680:
我不知道这些家伙从哪块石头里崩出来的，简直气死我了。

20160:
这些狗娘养的低空盘旋！

20640:
把这些装备卖掉，再加上一块钱也换不了一杯咖啡。

22080:
我找到窍门了。

22560:
这个单位的智囊都哪儿去了？

23040:
该死的我们还期待着什么？一个奇迹？

26400:
这里看起来太荒凉了，找Miguel就像在草丛里找根针一样困难。

26880:
有东西喷进我的眼睛里了，什么都看不清了。

27360:
我这辈子干不来。

27840:
好人啊。

28320:
我们知道这儿有敌人，看看我们能不能消灭他们。

28800:
他们仍在附近……不要太轻敌。

29760:
我真喜欢这只枪。

30240:
他看起来像那个老妈妈的孩子Joseph Graham，让我们抓住他。

30720:
那就让她来试试吧，Miguel。当我逮了她，她会后悔当初没去女校学学妇道的。

31200:
呀哈，宝贝。这是这批倒霉敌人的最后一个了。

31680:
谁偷的东西？最好在我打翻他之前吐出来。

32160:
老实躺着，母狗！告诉你们，如果她起来，我会再用枪打她，这是我今天干的最好的一件事。

32640:
天啊！天外动物！

33120:
Right on. I knew we'd see this day. I enjoyed it, too. I like this quickie, getting in and out, and not having to take back a whole country. Thanks again, for the experience.

33600:
啊。看起来那些还尿裤的家伙吓得跑掉了，现在就我们在这了。

34080:
我一秒钟后就呼呼大睡了，我回来工作时会告诉你的。

34560:
我醒了，继续。

35040:
嘿，我事先说过的。

35520:
这装备已经坏了，我怀疑不值得拿在手里。

36000:
喔！这玩意儿会伤人的。

36480:
我不想去那附近，即便这是这是唯一的出路。

36960:
快淹死了！妈的！快……〈咕噜〉让我离开这！

37440:
我到啦，该干点啥？

37920:
Good! With the laptop working again I don't feel quite as naked.

38400:
Holy dingleberry! That smarts!

38880:
Did the mountain jump out in front of you, flyboy?

39360:
I'm freezing my butt off. Let's get moving already.

39840:
This isn't going anywhere. I think we need a way to get into that door downstairs.

40320:
Forget it! From here on in, we're stuck with each other.

40800:
Brrrrr. My boobs feel like I'm in the frozen food section. Holy torpedo! It's cold!

41280:
There's the guard house. Let's bring the battle to them for a change.

41760:
Some paint would do wonders for this place.

42240:
Trust me, the next time I see snow it better be Christmas.

42720:
We didn't all make it. I sure hope we don't come up short later on.

43200:
Well... We have a way in, though I'm sure absolutely everybody is aware of that.

43680:
Well... I count everyone as being here. Should we move on?

44160:
That Mrs. Fung sure has a thing for rules.

44640:
Ugh! He gives me the creeps.

45120:
Blow it out your pipe, bigboy!

45600:
You realize he didn't mention anything about coming with us, did he?

46080:
If you know anything about the area you think we should know, don't be shy, Manuel.

46560:
Then, am I to belief this is the first time you change sides in mid-stream, Colonel? Would that be right, then?

47040:
Why do I get the feeling that one of us is gonna have to play babysitter?

47520:
Something tells me our trails just got a little happier. Welcome to the posse, Mr. Colburn.

48000:
This is different. I can't wait to try it out.

48480:
Ewwh! It doesn't seem very safe. I don't know...

48960:
Aww... he doesn't look so good.

49440:
Let me take a look at that letter.

49920:
Fine piece of work. You don't get to see something blow up like that every day. Heck of a nice ending to a great mission, too.

50400:
Looks like there's more than one guard house. Or maybe we got the attention of the military.

50880:
Would ya look at this. It's right out of a history book.

51360:
Looks like we took care of the cat problem. Those things were never meant to be indoors.

51840:
Wowwww! That's rich! Hahahhaaa! Ahh...Doodlehead!

52320:
Only thing not funny, is the doodlehead destroyed all his wares while blowing himself up.

52800:
Without cutters we can forget about getting through this thing quietly. Looks like I'll have to force it open.

53280:
The door's got "Nobody's Getting Through" written all over it.

53760:
Now, let's go see what just made that noise.

54240:
Sure glad I don't live around here. That noise would drive me nuts.

54720:
That's the alarm for the fan. Now's our chance.

55200:
Well... Look at this. It's the coordinates for the possible missile destinations. It's perfect! All the info we need to turn this place into a dustbowl without using explosives.

55680:
I just got to figure out how to use the control panel, then make a beeline for the elevator. Everything goes right, Deputy Commander Morris will be getting a burial like no other.
