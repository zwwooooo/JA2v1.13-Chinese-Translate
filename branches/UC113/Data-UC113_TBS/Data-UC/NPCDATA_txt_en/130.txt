Greetings! Dr. Mortimer, at your service. I am director of Restwell Gardens, in addition to being Danubia's official coroner and mortician.

480:
Are you here to enquire about a corpse, or make a booking?

960:
It's a pleasure to meet living people... My work, you know... Haha... That's a funeral parlor joke.

1440:
All these dreadful motor accidents lately. Well, I suppose Danubia's notoriously poor drivers are contributing to my growing wealth, so why complain?

1920:
More corpses are what I need. What could I possibly do with that? No thank you.

2400:
Dr. Mortimer, at your service. I bet in your line of business, death is an eventuality that may arrive sooner than in other occupations. Can I interest you in our all-inclusive package deal?

2880:
How would you like to try a spin on our conveyer belt beyond the grey curtains?

3360:
Well, thanks, but no thanks. I like dissecting, cremating and burying people, not actively participating in having them become corpses.

3840:
Morticia! Morticia find a first aid kit, I'm hit!

4320:
Please feel free to tour the memorial gardens and facilities. Are you sure you don't want to book a niche? Well, call back anytime. Send me our Queen's corpse when you're through.

4800:
Praise be, bodies being created virtually on my doorstep! Talk to me after the fighting's over.

5280:
Please excuse me, there is a cremation in progress. My presence is required to console the grieving family.

5760:
