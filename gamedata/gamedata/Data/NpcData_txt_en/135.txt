0:
You will be punished for your intrusion.

480:
I am surprised to see you alive.

960:
The Queen is a good woman. She is just under a tremendous amount of pressure.

1440:
It is too bad you do not know the Queen like I do.

1920:
I cannot take it.

2400:
I have no intention of telling you anything.

2880:
You are speaking with the Queen's most trusted advisor. You will show respect.

3360:
It is not even an option.

3840:
I have been wounded. As the Queen's advisor, you are compelled to offer me aid.

4320:
That is all I have to say to you.

4800:
Forgive the intrusion, Your Highness, but one of our North Patrols has been attacked!

5280:
Ahem... from what we have learned, Your Majesty, the rebels seem to have some sort of foreign aid - commando types. We speculate they arrived on the helicopter that was spotted earlier.

5760:
They may be hired mercenaries, Your Highness. There weren't many.

6240:
As you command, Your Highness.

6720:
Ahem... the rebel party seems to have used the element of surprise to their advantage, my Queen. They defeated us.

7200:
Yes, Your Highness.

7680:
Ahem... yes, Your Highness. I am. I regret the interruption, but it is important. Our reports confirm that the rebel party seems to have grown bolder, my Queen. There was an attack in Drassen.

8160:
Well, Your Highness, I regret to inform you, but they were victorious. They control Drassen, Your Majesty.

8640:
Ahem... and I would not have bothered you had it not been important, Your Highness.

9120:
The rebels have...

9600:
Not exactly, my Queen. They, how shall I say, occupy the city of Cambria.

10080:
Ahem... my Queen, I believe I do. It seems these mercenaries, while a small group, are apparently well trained and equipped. They have recently secured Alma.

10560:
Yes, Your Majesty.

11040:
Yes, Your Highness. Plenty?

11520:
No, I do have some good news, Your Highness. You are still in power. Ahem... however, it seems that the mercenaries have taken Grumm.

12000:
You would like me to summon them, my Queen?

12480:
Ahem... actually, Your Highness, it is rather bad.

12960:
Your Highness, these foreigners, these mercenaries, have overrun Chitzena. So far, however, ours has been a valiant effort.

13440:
Ahem... I regret to inform you, Your Highness, that I do indeed have a troubling report. Our north west SAM site is now in the hands of the rebels.

13920:
Perfectly clear, Your Majesty.

14400:
Ahem, Your Highness, I have an urgent report. The rebels attacked us at our north east SAM.

14880:
No, my Queen, um, rather, we were. Apparently, the guards were taken quite by surprise.

15360:
Ahem, I am sorry to hear that, Your Highness. I only wish to keep you informed on the progress of our troops.

15840:
The Central SAM has been overrun by the mercenaries. Our troops did not anticipate...

16320:
Ahem... Not exactly, Your Highness. From theirs.

16800:
Ahem... Yes, your majesty, it seems the flowers are a gift to Your Highness from the mercenaries. Perhaps they have taken a fondness toward you?

17280:
They are rather pretty, Your Highness.

17760:
Ahem... I am an idiot, Your Highness.

18240:
Of course, my Queen. I know that you are a very busy woman. But, I insisted that I see you right away. I bring GREAT news!

18720:
Yes, Your Highness, I am pleased to report that we have taken back one of the cities. The report should be coming in soon.

19200:
Yes, Your Highness! It is just as you requested, and, while I regret that your troops were not able to capture all of them, this is certainly a start.

19680:
As you command, Your Highness. Should I release them, then? It has been a most cooperative and informative interrogation.

20160:
he-heh, heh, heh, heh. You idiot!

20640:
As you command, Your Highness. Should I summon the doctor to treat the injuries here?

21120:
I am sorry, Your Highness. And I regret that I do indeed bring another troubling report.

21600:
Ahem... well, it seems, that, how should I say, the people, are, well...

22080:
Ahem, yes, Your Highness. It seems the people, your subjects, are turning against you.

22560:
Ahem... well, yes, my Queen. Reports state that some are even speaking openly against you, and there are others who are quietly getting behind the rebel movement.

23040:
Your Highness?

23520:
Ahem... Your Highness, that is not our helicopter.

24000:
Ahem... In fact, I was just now coming to report this to you. The rebel forces, it seems, have secured the services of one Mr. James Bullock, or Skyrider as I believe he is known.

24480:
Hello, Your Highness. I have...

24960:
Ahem... with all due respect, Your Highness, I feel that I can say nothing which would please my Queen, the country such as it is.

25440:
Ahem... Dr. Kairns is missing from your research facility in Orta, Your Highness. He has not been seen for quite some time, and no one is certain of his whereabouts.

25920:
Yes, Your Highness. It is so.

26400:
Ahem, yes, Your Highness, very clear.

26880:
Ahem... good day, Your Highness. I have an urgent report for you.

27360:
Ahem... with all due respect, Your Highness, you need to hear this. The mercenary forces have been spotted on the outskirts of Meduna, and...

27840:
Would you like me to extend them an offer, my Queen?

28320:
Actually, Your Highness... I'll.... I'll clean it up myself. It's not a bother, really...

28800:
Ahem... Apparently...not, Your Highness. I will try harder.

29280:
Splendid, Your Highness. What is it?

29760:
Your... Your Majesty...

30240:
But, but... Ahem, Your Highness, the Crepitus will come out! They'll kill the miners, the people, even our troops! I say this of course, with all due respect.

30720:
Very good.

31200:
I can't be bought.

31680:
The Queen will make you pay!

32160:
Forgive the intrusion, Your Highness, but Administrators in Drassen have been attacked!

32640:
Forgive the intrusion, Your Highness, but Administrators in Cambria have been attacked!

33120:
Not yet, Your Majesty.

33600:
There is good news, Your Majesty. Your quick thinking troops managed to disable it. It could take the rebels days to repair it so that it's usable.

34080:
Not keeping you informed, Your Majesty?

34560:
With all due respect, my Queen, are you certain? How do you know?

35040:
Oh, you must be so happy, my Highness. I know how much you enjoy it when your friends from Balime visit.

35520:
Yes, Your Majesty, I'll get them right on it. Just as soon as they're finished helping your friends with their bags.

36000:
As you wish, my Queen.
