Peter Klaus. Some of my closer friends call me Kingpin.

480:
I trust you are enjoying my town.

960:
Your small talk is of little interest to me.

1440:
My time is limited.

1920:
Your gift is of no value to me.

2400:
Everything in San Mona belongs to me. The responsibility is enormous.

2880:
We'll pretend you are ignorant, and you do not know who you are threatening. Do it again, and we'll pretend that you are dead.

3360:
Hahahah... You can't be serious!

3840:
Son-of-a-bitch...

4320:
You can leave now.

4800:
I will put this money towards improving my little town.

5280:
I understand we're in for some entertainment. I never miss a good bout, especially not when there's new blood in the battle.

5760:
I run a nice little town here. You are welcome to enjoy the facilities. We have everything... I am sure you will find something that caters to your needs.

6240:
Just keep in mind that you are my guest. While you take your well-deserved break from the rigors of war, I expect you to behave as such.

6720:
Very well then. Let's get on with this exhibition...

7200:
You were warned...

7680:
You're messing with the wrong man...

8160:
Good. However, we have a minor problem. It seems someone has found out where I do my banking. This certain someone has made, let's say, an unauthorized withdrawl.

8640:
I'm not a finger-pointing type of fellow, but I do expect YOU to give it back to me. As a matter of fact, I was hoping we could settle this right now, put it behind us. Of course, there will be a 25 percent service fee.

9120:
Something to cover my inconvenience, you understand. I'm a reasonable man. I'll give you 48 hours to deliver it to me. To me personally, or I'll hunt you down and kill you.

9600:
I knew you were a sensible person. And to show you I am the same, I will erase this whole episode from my mind. I mean, how could you have known it was my money? And you are enjoying San Mona, are you not?

10080:
A downpayment, but we are not quite squared off yet.

10560:
You impressed me. Showed a determination I did not believe you had. You know, you should drop by my house sometime. It is south of here. Not very far, within walking distance.

11040:
I'll tell Damon to be expecting you. We might just be able to help each other out. You think about it.

11520:
We will have to pick this up another time...

12000:
I built it from nothing, by doing people favors. I am a generous man who enjoys seeing people entertained. I am also an avid collector who appreciates the rarity of some of the finer things in life.

12480:
I have a proposition I want you to consider. There is a museum in Balime. On display is a rather precious piece of Arulcan history. The diamond-encrusted Golden Chalice of Chance.

12960:
It is encased there for the benefit of the rich. Balime is a town inhabited by friends and associates of Deidranna. Since she is a sworn enemy of yours, I thought perhaps you might be willing to get it for me.

13440:
I would reward you, of course, and you would surely feel better knowing that the common folk, the working people of San Mona, would be given the opportunity to share in a piece of their ancient history.

13920:
I would do it myself, or rather, have my people do it, but I can't have Deidranna believing I am in any way involved. She and I have a special, unique relationship and something like this would no doubt sour it.

14400:
Whether this is something that interests you, or not, is entirely up to you. But keep in mind during your travels that I will pay twenty thousand dollars in cash for the Chalice.

14880:
Let's get right to the point. Did you manage to get me the Golden Chalice of Chance or not? I can barely wait to see it.

15360:
Ah... It is just like I remembered it. Magnificent, simply magnificent.

15840:
And this, my dear friend, is for you. Perhaps, you will find some of the attractions in town to be worthy of your hard earned dollars.

16320:
Another bout. I am looking forward to a close one.

16800:
A most enjoyable event. Whenever you wish to partake in another, please make the necessary arrangements with my assistant, Darren.

17280:
I hope you are bringing me good news and money. Time is running out, and so is my patience.
