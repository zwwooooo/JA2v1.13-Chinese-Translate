Yup. That helicopter works all right, but you killed the pilot. Course, there was another fella. Can't remember his name.

5760:
Saw him around here, oh, not a week ago, wearing big wader boots. He kinda smelt like a swamp, too.

6240:
Think he's in some kinda trouble with the Army... He was sneaking around, making sure nobody saw him. He's probably one of them draft dodger fellas.

Bet the Army could really use another pilot, too. You kinda created an immediate openin'.
