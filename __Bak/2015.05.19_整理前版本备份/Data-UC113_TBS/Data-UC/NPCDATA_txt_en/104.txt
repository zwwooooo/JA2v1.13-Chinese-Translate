Welcome to my bar. I am Manny, one of the famous De Santos bartending brothers.

480:
I prepare many exotic drinks. Information is also on the menu.

960:
Welcome friends, please be seated. What can I serve you?

1440:
I understand you are interested in weapons. Perhaps I can help. A friend of the rebels has vouched for your discretion, so I will tell you all I know.

1920:
Thank you. Your generosity is welcome, but I have that already.

2400:
If you are interested in trading weapons, see Tony at Port Kip. I think he is a front for Walter Smirnoff's gunrunners. They all wear tan coloured pants and white shirts.

2880:
Hey, don't be like that! I'm trying to help you!

3360:
My life is predictable, though boring. Better than being involved with guns though. Sorry, I must decline your offer.

3840:
Blood, aarrrrggghh! Call a doctor... Help, I'm wounded...

4320:
I hope the information has been useful. My brother Peter has a bar in sector E13.

Hey!

14400:
I'm too busy ducking bullets to talk now!

A man named Walter Smirnoff organizes widespread smuggling throughout Danubia. He has no political affiliations, but does supply criminal gangs with weapons which destabilizes the country.

15360:
You will find several gunrunner depots around the country. They also use Calisto airport freight terminal. Be careful, these guys are well armed, shoot first, then ask questions later.

15840:
There are gunrunner depots east of Calisto, east of Galileo, east of Troy, and west of Galileo. Could be more. They transport contraband around the country using small, escorted convoys.

16320:
Walter Smirnoff can sometimes be found at a small grass airstrip east of Rudesa. He often picks up shipments smuggled in by light planes.
