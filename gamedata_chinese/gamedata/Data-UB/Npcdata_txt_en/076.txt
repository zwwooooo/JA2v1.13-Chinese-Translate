How you doing? Jerry Melo... I'm your lift into Tracona. Your flight was prepaid by some Enrico Chivaldori guy. Pretty much ready to go... mechanic is just finishing up with some last minute tinkering.

480:
Got room for six bodies, man. Can't take no more than that. Understand the whole operation's covert. That's cool, man. Real cool! Get back to ya.

960:
Should be making tracks, man.

1440:
Made a lot of noise. Someone's bound to check it out, man.

1920:
Can't say I'm looking for anything else to carry back, man.

2400:
I'm thinking maybe you should head east... like yesterday.

2880:
Leave it alone. Drop it already!

3360:
Heck... No! You dudes aren't off to a very good start, man.

3840:
I'm messed up... bad... man.

4320:
This whole scene is making me nervous, man.

4800:
Maybe I'll find somewhere to spend it on the way back.

5280:
We're overloaded, man. Six is max. You gotta make some decisions.

5760:
We been down this road... haven't we, man? Got room for six. Do a head count.

6240:
We still got room in the chopper if you're looking to take anyone else. Got full-comfort seating for up to six.

6720:
Everyone in one piece? Man! Those things don't exactly glide... We're lucky to still be here.

7200:
Looks like we're all accounted for... Don't go ragging on me. You try flying a rock, man. I got you here. You're in Tracona.

7680:
Think your laptop took a beating though... Transmitter's whacked, man. Looks like you're out of touch with the world for a while. Probably get another one in the town of Varrez. Think it's, uh,  east of here, man.

8160:
Me? I'm headed West. Back to Arulco. Before the border dudes show. I'll tell that Enrico guy that your transmitter is messed for awhile. Enjoy your stay... And bring us all back something nice.

8640:
Ya... think mine are frozen too, man.

9120:
Still got your butt here in one piece. Think that was easy, man?

9600:
I'm a pilot... not a commando. Take care of this before I blow a bowel, man...

10080:
That's it? Buckle down. Next stop Tracona. There's no in-flight meals.

10560:
Guess I kinda owe you, man.

11040:
Is that's the thanks I get, you freakin' jerk?

11520:
Looks like I'm flying out a full load. Understand the whole operation's covert. That's cool, man. Just give me the word when it's time to crank her up.

12000:
Who am I flying to Tracona, man? Got no reason to fly there myself.

12480:
I think ya really ought to head for Varrez, man.
