Hi! I'm nurse Clarice Starling.

480:
You could write a book about the antics going on here.

960:
If I were you, I'd watch my back around Dr. Lecter...

1440:
Take our guests to the cafeteria? Off course, Dr. Lecter. Come this way, guys.

1920:
What I need is a stiff drink, not that. Thanks anyway.

2400:
A pleasure to meet you! Nurse Starling.

2880:
You try that out, buddy, and pretty soon you'll be wearing a body bag.

3360:
Ah, no thanks. I have a mission here.

3840:
Do you have a bandaid? Hell... Where's the first aid box?

4320:
Hope you enjoyed the tour and refreshments. If you spot Postie anywhere, let the police know.

4800:
Not the time for small talk. See me when the shooting stops.
