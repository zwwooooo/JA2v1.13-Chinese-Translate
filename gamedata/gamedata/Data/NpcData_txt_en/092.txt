I'm Frank. Keeper of the ale for whatever ails you.

480:
Welcome back...

960:
I meet all kinds. Some are more interesting than others.

1440:
I don't nip at the stuff, myself. Not at work anyway... Just weekends, and only when I have friends over. Holidays, too, I guess, if they count.

1920:
I'd prefer cash.

2400:
Money talks, bullshit walks. You ever hear that?

2880:
You don't want to be pushing yourself on people in this town. We aren't like the rest of the country.

3360:
Ya, sure, right... Think it out a bit. Surrounded by booze or bullets? It really ain't worth askin'.

3840:
What badass luck... Ya gotta get me something to drink for the pain...

4320:
I won't be far if you need me.

4800:
Muchos gracias.

5280:
So, what can I get ya?

5760:
Decisions... Decisions... Decisions...

6240:
Hey, we're open for a while yet - take your time.

6720:
Hope you aren't planning to pay for your booze with that.

7200:
I don't want to purchase anything, man. I'm running a bar not a freakin' flea market.

7680:
Hmm, interesting stuff...

8640:
But I only accept cash.

10560:
Tipping is permitted, you know.

11040:
Here ya go. And thanks for the tip.

11520:
Give me a holler when you're ready for more.

12000:
Whatever... just let me know when you're ready.

12480:
Drink up, there... or maybe you want this to go?

13440:
Look, I tried to be polite, but you're making it personal. Either you drop the attitude, or I drop-kick your nambyass-ass the hell out of here.

13920:
What are you, stupid? You don't understand English? Understand this, twit!

14400:
You weren't invited, turdfly!

14880:
Carmen was around. Told me to pass the word... He's in Cambria, if you're looking for him.

15360:
If you're looking for Carmen, well ya just missed him. He's headed to Drassen.

15840:
Over there is someone I think you should meet. I can vouch for him. Carmen comes in here a lot.

16320:
Have you checked out the extreme fighting at the club? I'm sure, it's...something ya'd get into. Just tell Darren that Frank sent ya. He'll take care of everything.

16800:
If you haven't had the chance to see San Mona, I recommend you put aside some time to spend at the Shady Lady. Ask about the full massage. It includes a facial which you will not soon forget.

17280:
You're lucky you ran into me... Kingpin knows it was you who stole his money. If I was in your shoes, I'd give it back to him personally within the next 48 hours. Course, he'll want more than you took, but he might spare your life.

17760:
Kingpin has put the word out about ya. A friendly piece of bartender advice from someone who's known him for a long time, pay every last cent of it back before they come looking for ya.

18240:
Ha, ha! Liquor license? We don't need no freakin' liquor license.

18720:
The boss is driving me crazy. Kingpin's driving everybody crazy. His favorite hooker disappeared, and he's tearing up the town looking for her.

19200:
It's been last call for the last hour. C'mon, it's time to go. I got to close it up here.
