Dead guy.

480:
It's killin' time.

960:
I think I pissed my pants.

1440:
Another chunk of creepin' colon.

1920:
Whooee, that ugly sumbitch looks like when I had this thing where they took out most of my colon 'cuz I O.D.'d on some pumpkin seeds, and like, that's what my colon looked like, I think.

2400:
Ugh! Colon's been here!

2880:
I heard sumpthin'. Mighta been my stomach. Might notta.

3360:
Like, those creepin' things not only LOOK like my colon, I mean, they SMELL like it, too!

3840:
I'm sweatin'. I think that happens whenever it's like there's sumpthin' dangerous gonna happen...or, like, when I eat chili.

4320:
Hey, man, like, tell me if you see any crawlin' hunks of my colon.

4800:
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, I'm gonna get murdered by a colon!

5280:
There's sumpthin' there.

5760:
I see a thing.

6240:
Think my gun's empty.

6720:
Owww...oh, God, I feel like the time when I tried fixin' my Daddy's chipper- shredder, y'know.

7200:
Oh, man, Vicki, you're dead! You were the babe of all babes! I woulda killed ANYTHING for you! Now you're dead? Oh, Jesus, I swear I'm never fallin' in love with ANYthing ever again.

8640:
Can someone remind me what I'm supposed to do?

9120:
All right. My gun's jammed. I like fixin' things.

9600:
Why's everyone always shooting at me?

10080:
I'm fine, 'cuz, like, blows to the head don't do me. I mean, don't do any damage to me.

10560:
That was, like, close. I mean, I felt like it was close, y'know?

11040:
You want me to take THAT shot? In my dreams, maybe.

11520:
I'm bleedin', I mean, bad, like the time I bit myself on the ankle. That's like a long story, though.

12000:
<yawn> I'm really tired.

12480:
I can hardly breathe.

12960:
Wipeout!

13440:
Hey, I took out a colon!

13920:
If I ever catch that Commie Ivan out of uniform, I mean, he's gonna be like one black-and-blue Russian!

14880:
I hate Igor, man. I mean, I'd smash his head in if he didn't have real kickass vodka.

15360:
I'm not dealin' with Igor anymore, man. I mean, I can't work with Russkies. So, like, I'm splittin'. Bye.

15840:
Whoa. That reminds me of the time I tried to fix my grandma's chopping thing, what do you call it... guillotine! That was bad.

16320:
This whole thing reminds me of... something about... well, I forgot.

16800:
Finished.

17280:
I mean, you gotta be kiddin'.

17760:
That's what you get for being a squirrel head, y'know?

18240:
That felt really good! Like takin' a good dump!

18720:
Aah, that's... I mean, what a nimrod.

19200:
I'm startin' to think this whole freakin' mess is... just a whole... freakin'... mess. I'm not good with words.

19680:
I mean, I can't believe I gotta work with all these numbnuts.

20160:
Air raid!

20640:
These supplies are so lame! I made better weapons in jail, I mean, seriously!

21120:
I hate workin' with all these pinko pansy commie bedwetters.

21600:
They say the Cold War is over, but as long as there's still a Russia over there in... somewhere, I say the Cold War ain't over yet!

22080:
I'm paying attention.

22560:
Oh, yeah, I like your style!

23040:
Maybe it was the wind?

23520:
Livin' with Ivan's like livin' with an itch in my butt that I just wanna  scratch right out. I'm blowin' this pop stand. Maybe next time.

24480:
Vicki's such a babe, y'know? I mean... and she gives real good brake jobs.

25920:
Hey, I hear from M.E.R.C. that you're stiffin' them, man! I'm splittin', and you're lucky I'm a softie, or you'd need a plumber to help you swallow your lunch!

26880:
I can't see! Like the time I got battery acid in my eyes...and nose and ears and mouth.

27360:
I'm not figurin' sumpthin' right. And my head hurts too much to do any more figurin'.

27840:
Kinda friendly. Maybe we shoulda left some kinda gift.

28320:
Found some bad guys. Well... I didn't really find 'em, but I know they're in the neighborhood.

28800:
Where, oh, where are they hiding?

29280:
Holy squirrel tails! It must be my birthday.

30240:
I know that kid from somewhere...

30720:
Well, I'll be. I guess I'll just go back on home then and kill squirrels. Kinda too bad, 'cause people make a lot funnier noises.

31200:
Yeah! Blew 'em all away!

31680:
Oh no. Like, I think someone put their hands in our cookie jar. We catch 'em, we should chop off their hands, just like in the bible.

32160:
Let's just say that my mama woulda approved. She asked for it. I could see clear to Kansas before I'd see another way.

32640:
What luck... A big squirrel with plenty of attitude.

33120:
This is, like, the happiest I ever felt in my whole life! Well, there was that one time with sweet Billie-Ray, and if it hadn't been for that cow... well, nevermind. Y'all don't forget me now. Send a postcard or something.

33600:
I reckon they threw her in reverse. There's no one here anymore.

34080:
Gonna get me some shuteye. I'm not running on all cylinders.

34560:
Rooster rising. I'll get right back to work.

35040:
Golly! Me too.

35520:
It broke! This was manufactured in Commieland, wasn't it?

36000:
Ooohee! No can, no how. That's trouble.

36480:
Now hold your horses. I don't trust walking around here.

36960:
Oh sweet Jesus, I'm goin' under...

37440:
Trip's over. I'm parked.
