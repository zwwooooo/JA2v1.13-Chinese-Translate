I've got trouble here!

1440:
Found a target!

1920:
Found a target!

2400:
Damn!

2880:
Got to stay cautious.

3360:
Damn!

3840:
I never wear undergarments on the battlefield. It keeps me cautious!

4320:
Got to stay cautious. Don't want to mess it up now!

4800:
I'm having some troubles!

5280:
There's something here.

5760:
There's something here.

6240:
My gun is out of ammo!

6720:
I think I'm in serious trouble! I can't feel my feet...

9120:
What a time for my gun to jam!

9600:
Got lead flying in my direction!

10080:
I have blood dripping down my leg.

10560:
That was a close call...

11040:
I should wait for a better opportunity.

11520:
I have blood dripping down my leg.

12000:
The conditions weren't ideal

12480:
If I keep up this pace, I'm going to pass out.

12960:
That's the way it's done!

13440:
That's the way it's done!

15360:
That's the way it's done!

15840:
Violence... It's just not for everyone.

16320:
DAMN!

16800:
Everything's done. I'm on the clock!

17280:
It's going to hurt me to do it...

17760:
That's the way it's done!

18240:
That's the way it's done!

19200:
Is it true that your team is selling cookies?

19680:
You're a mercenary's dream. Low risk and a full day's pay!

20160:
Are you waiting for reinforcements?

20640:
This thing isn't even working!

22080:
It's been a pleasure working for you. More of a pleasure than you'll ever know.

22560:
Just what the hell are you looking for?

23040:
Just what the hell are you looking for?

25920:
Time is working against us.

26400:
I've got trouble here!

27360:
This type of stuff ain't exactly my strong point.

28320:
I wouldn't be shocked if there were mines around here.

28800:
Maybe they got scared and left.

29760:
Be sure to write!

30720:
Well... You're hanging tough! Make 'em eat their words this time around.

31200:
You can kiss those guys goodbye!

32160:
That's the way it's done!

32640:
I've got trouble here!

33120:
Money's nice, but coming out on top is even better!

33600:
Maybe they got scared and left.

34080:
If I keep up this pace, I'm going to pass out.

34560:
What a loudmouth... I'm glad I'm working for you!

35040:
You're in the ballpark, but you're in the cheap seats!

35520:
This thing isn't even working!

36000:
It's a boobytrap... Not much of one... I should be able to disarm it.

36480:
It's a boobytrap... Not much of one... I should be able to disarm it.

36960:
Swallowing too much water... Can't keep my head up...

37440:
This mission's behind us.

38400:
Poor planning, bad luck, whatever... You'd better start making some headway if you want me to consider joining your team.

38880:
It's too risky working for you. Call me if you learn not to take so many chances with our lives!

39360:
Maybe...when I first started, I might have put up with the insanity of revolving mercenaries, but not anymore! I quit!

39840:
And you can keep your money tucked safely in your pocket, because that's my final word!

40320:
If you're ever in need of a competent explosives expert, you know where to find me.

40800:
I'm not interested! With your personnel practices, you should get a revolving door installed in your office!

42720:
Time is working against us.

43200:
As promised... You were outbid!

43680:
You're the type of commander I might even enjoy working for!

45600:
I can't be part of this losing effort any longer!

46080:
For the umpteenth time...

46560:
I don't accept credit cards, IOU's, checks, or camels... It's cash! And you don't have it.

47040:
I just need time to work out some details.

47520:
I can't be part of this losing effort any longer!

50880:
For the umpteenth time...

51360:
I don't accept credit cards, IOU's, checks, or camels... It's cash! And you don't have it.

51840:
If you're shopping for an explosive expert, feel free to check out the competition. I have no family history of psychiatric illness or sheet metal in my head.

52320:
I don't take unnecessary risks. You'll have to run the operation with hardly any casualties if you want me to go.

52800:
You might want to stay away from the low-end guys. They only end-up shooting each other.

53280:
I don't accept credit cards, IOU's, checks, or camels...

53760:
Show some decency and leave me alone!

55200:
I'm scheduled to do a fireworks' show tonight in Libya.

55680:
Now what are you going to do for an explosive specialist? Hire one of those basket cases?
