Careful you don't go touching levers, switches or stuff. Don't want any disasters or meltdowns happenin' on my watch.

480:
How goes it?

960:
When you've been at this job as long as me, nothing surprises you anymore. Seen it all.

1440:
Had four men report sick today. Heard there's a virus going 'round. Hope you're feeling okay.

1920:
Well, that's kind of you, but I don't need it.

2400:
Until you showed up, I couldn't imagine Brenda's reign coming to an end. Now I got hope.

2880:
I understand... I know you got a lot on your shoulders.

3360:
To be honest with you, I'd rather stay with what I know. Been running this plant for years, kinda attached to it.

3840:
Can't take this pain...

4320:
I know you haven't got all day to stand around and chat, so I'll be getting on with plant administration. Need to do an inventory.

4800:
That'll heal up just fine now.

5280:
You madman! Don't ever look for my help again.

5760:
I'm the guy in charge of the plant and it's damn good to meet you. Me and some of the guys are willing to keep on working; turn the income directly over to you.

6240:
Matter of fact... I'll see who's willing to continue working.

6720:
News on this end is bad. We haven't had any deliveries of raw materials for days. Supply convoys have been disrupted with all the fighting going on. Probably just a question of time before the plant closes.

7200:
We got a problem. I'm gonna have to shut her down.

7680:
For a while there, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. I had to do some quick talking just to stay alive.

8160:
It's too risky. We'll talk later.

8640:
I don't know how you guys do it. I'm waiting for the day DNN shows footage of Brenda and her cronies dangling from a tree.

9120:
News on this end is good. We are producing Crepaboost at maximum capacity. You're now the sole beneficiary, straight into that account number you provided.

9600:
I realize production is low, but it's just not easy with the shortages.

10080:
I've worked this plant for over nine years. Don't know how I'm gonna get by now.

10560:
No thanks. Might be other people who need it though.

11040:
Had to shut the plant down.

11520:
Plant's clear.
