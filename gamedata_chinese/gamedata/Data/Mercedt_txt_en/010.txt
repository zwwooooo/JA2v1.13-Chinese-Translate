0:
Unfriendlies.

480:
We've got company.

960:
Can't keep this up much longer.

1440:
I shoulda packed bug spray.

1920:
What I need is a 50-foot can of something really bad for the environment.

2400:
Looks like the roaches did some stompin' of their own here.

2880:
Something's moving around.

3360:
Smells like an outhouse...

3840:
My spidey sense is tingling.

4320:
Next time, I'm bringing bug repellent.

4800:
Got a whole infestation on my hands here!

5280:
Want a closer look at that.

5760:
Got something over here.

6240:
Chamber's empty.

6720:
I'm not doing so well.

8640:
Lost my bearings for a second.

9120:
Damned weapon doesn't want to fire.

9600:
I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time.

10080:
Took a hazing there.

10560:
That was close enough.

11040:
Crappy odds on making that shot.

11520:
I gotta stop this bleeding. It leaves a trail.

12000:
Time to sleep. Don't want to lose my concentration.

12480:
I need to get my breathing under control.

12960:
Didn't even say goodbye.

13440:
They check in, but they don't check out.

15360:
Mike is down. Can't say I'm sorry about it.

15840:
What a mess. Where's the dignity?

16800:
Finished here. I need something to do.

17280:
Can't go along with that.

17760:
She's more beautiful dead than she ever was alive.

18240:
I'm glad...but I got a feeling that bug's going to be alive in my dreams for a long time to come.

18720:
Got no use for people like that.

19200:
Getting awfully hard to keep a positive attitude around here!

19680:
Too much talk around here. Not enough discretion.

20160:
Aircraft approaching, take cover!

20640:
Great equipment. Somebody get it on special?

21120:
Hey, where I come from, two's a crowd.

21600:
The Cold War may officially be over, but Russian Imperialism is still alive and well. Just go by their actions, not their words.

22080:
That's measurable progress.

22560:
That's a plan?

23040:
That had disaster written all over it.

25920:
Isn't the time. Not convinced this is right yet.

26400:
Mike's here. Killing Mike... hmm.

26880:
I'm blind. Stings worse than rubbing alcohol.

27360:
Wish I could, but I can't.

27840:
I wish him the best.

28320:
We know they're there. It's just a question of finding them.

28800:
Have to keep our eyes open for the ones that still remain.

29760:
Lethal. That's what you are.

30240:
I think that's the kid we're supposed to bring home to mommy.

30720:
She won't. And she won't see it coming. We'll get the job done.

31200:
That did it! Nothing left to kill.

31680:
We been short-shipped... it's not all here.

32160:
What did she expect? Don't see any reason to feel bad about it.

32640:
That cat knows how to blend.

33120:
Think I liked this. Not usually one to say it, but it was a good trip. Maybe you'll see me around... but I'll probably see you first.

33600:
Alone again. Unfriendlies high-tailed it out of here.

34080:
Yeah, I better sleep. Don't want to do a bad job.

34560:
I'm awake and at it.

35040:
I was just gonna say that.

35520:
Figures. Factory seconds always break.

36000:
Trapped! Here's an intentional accident waiting to happen.

36480:
Hmm. Could be anything in the ground, but it doesn't look good.

36960:
Try to notice me here... I'm drowning!

37440:
Okay, I got here... What's up?

38400:
No sir, I'd prefer a leader who inspires more confidence.

38880:
No... but I'll tell you what. If I hear of any suicide jockeys who're available, I'll send them your way.

39360:
I'm not going to be available. Let's just say I'm visiting a sick friend.

39840:
I'll be incommunicado for a while. Let me know in advance next time. I'll see what I can do.

40320:
If you're getting this message, I may or may not be available. Let me know where you can be reached if you want me to return the call. Don't look for me. You won't find me.

40800:
Get in touch with me if you want me to do any more work for you. We might be able to work something out.

42720:
I could make myself available if you want to extend my contract.

43200:
All right. I'm staying.

43680:
Yeah, okay, we'll see how well we work together. You don't like my style, I don't like yours, we shake hands when the contract's over and call it a wash.

45600:
It didn't work out. You'll have to find somebody else.

46080:
Don't make me repeat myself. I told you...

46560:
I'm not signing on with a charity case.

47040:
Fine. Last thing I want to do is push myself on you. I'll see you before you see me.

47520:
No... but I'll tell you what. If I hear of any suicide jockeys who're available, I'll send them your way.

50880:
Don't make me repeat myself. I told you...

51360:
I'm not signing on with a charity case.

51840:
Mmm?

52320:
I don't like hanging out on the phone.

52800:
You starin' at me?

53280:
How long's the job?

53760:
This isn't a chat line. Try me again when you know what you need.

55200:
Contract's almost up, in case it slipped your mind.

55680:
Pays to keep climbing the ladder. I go up and so do the dollars.
