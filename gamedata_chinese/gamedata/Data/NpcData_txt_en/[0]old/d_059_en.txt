Yeah, this is Arulco's secondary commercial airstrip. She's ferrying stuff in and out of here all the time. She's got one of her goons to keep an eye on it, too

320:
. Man, I'd love to take him out.

640:
the local airstrip. Believe it or not, there was a time when people used it for pleasure, before the Queen bombed it, that is.

960:
Now this is an oddity. Drassen actually has a church here. Why the Queen lets it continue is anybody's guess, but I'd bet my bottom dollar that something's up.

Father Walker says she fears crossing the Pope.

1920:
The Queen keeps a bunch of stuff in a warehouse here. I'm not exactly certain what, I mean, I've never been inside, but I presume it's things that they use in t

2240:
heir training. Bunch of pigs.

2560:
litary Prison here. Mostly confines army personnel who ask too many questions or don't do as they're told.

2880:
And I'll tell you another thing, too. I've seen a lot of people go in there, and they don't come out. They don't go anywhere! They just disappear - no bones, no

3200:
 bodies, no nothing.

3520:
nd they pretty much work in the mines day in and day out. Problem is, she's got Goons here watching. They don't have a choice.

3840:
They got a hospital here in Cambria. You ask me, it's pretty much a free-range virus farm, but beggars can't be choosers now, can they?

QaQ_OjnSCSoxvwpakHMvqneltLpUDLqTXZyOun@bWrcXPlC]LZ`ucqoqkpRNSaaTbOfA{SEuii]RFxUBThere's a university here that's as empty as the bitch's head. Queen shut it dow

4480:

4800:
You'll notice that the homes here are better than most. You know why? 'Cause flippin' doctors always make more money than everyone else, that's why! Happens eve

5120:

5440:
e have to be careful. The Queen's got a Goon here who's got his beady little eyes into everything. I'd hurt him.

5760:
This is probably the only part of San Mona you can show on postcards, well except for the fire that trashed the view up north. Everything here's pretty much on

the up and up.

6400:
s of Arulco, except it's all owned by one man.

6720:
There's this guy here, name's Kingpin... you can tell he thinks he's a big shot, huh? Well, he owns everything and he runs his exclusive club. Gotta be a MEMBER

7040:
 or a friend to get in. Well, screw him. I don't need it.

7360:
em, I'd say something! They just schlep to the mines every day for the Queen. Even if she does have one of her Goons here, I'd say something!

7680:
Got some Ruins here in Chitzena. Box of rocks used to be a tourist attraction. Brought in all kinds of dough for Arulco over a decade ago. I was never much for

8320:
s spewing all kinds of pollution all over the place! Town of Grumm's pretty industrial.

8640:
Got some shops here in Grumm, but they tend to keep quiet. Guess they figure what the Queen doesn't know, the Queen won't disturb. Of course, that's stupid if y

8960:
ou ask me. She knows everything.

9280:
uff. In my opinion, no one in Grumm is gonna live past the age of 25... and those are the non-smokers.

9600:
Now that we're here, you can get used to the taste of barbeque pit in your mouth. They burn plenty of coal around here. There's a bar nearby, so we can get some

9920:
thing to wash the taste out.

10240:
. That was when you saw cars in Arulco. Gas is next to impossible to come by. The Queen only imports enough for her purposes.

10560:
Queen's got a nature center here, but I don't know if I'm buying it. Got lots of body parts coming and going, but on the other hand, they ARE studying Bloodcats

10880:
... so maybe they're just not careful. Hard to say.

11200:
'm bitter! I don't care. I'm about to get even.

11520:
They got a museum here that smells of an assbackwards Robin Hood. Queen stole every artifact and article of value from the poor and put it on display for the ri

12160:
een, Queen, I'd take out your spleen, but how does your garden grow? With Silver Bells and mortar shells, and your soldiers all in a row.

12480:
This is where her palace is. Oh, I've been waiting for this! If it were me, I'd just rush right in and shoot her. Twice!

14400:
Ain't so bad in this part of Meduna, but it's bad enough. Think we can expect some serious defenses. We're ready for them, huh? Got a few homes and stores here,

14720:

15040:

Prepare to meet resistance! The Queen has one of her SAM sites located here.
