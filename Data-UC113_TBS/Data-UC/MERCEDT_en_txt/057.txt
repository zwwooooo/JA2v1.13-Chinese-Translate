We have a douche bag convention over here!

1440:
Holy Cucaracha on steroids, Batman!

1920:
I don?t think my can of Raid is gonna work here, Dude!

2400:
Go ahead squish it with a rolled up newspaper, I DARE YA!

2880:
Shut Up! I hear something.

3360:
I knew all those drugs in the seventies would come back to haunt me.

3840:
I think I?m gonna hurl.

4320:
I?m definitely off the sauce from now on.

4800:
Is anyone else seeing a pink elephant over there?

5280:
Well, lookie here.

5760:
I just might be able to use this.

6240:
Gotta reload

6720:
I?m thinking a hospital would be a great place to be right now.

7200:
Now I have to get some payback on you bastards. I?ll pop a couple of these punks for you Buzz.

7680:
Fox, DAMMIT! Are they doing this just to piss me off?

8160:
Man, this just gets better and better doesn?t it? Permission to dig Ayanna?s hole, SIR! 

8640:
Somebody wanna tell me what the HELL we?re doing again?

9120:
Oh SHIT, piece of crap jammed!

9600:
I guess a couple of NUKES would go good right there.

10080:
Man, that really stings. Anybody got a Band Aid?

10560:
Damn that nearly changed where I part my hair! 

11040:
Minnesota Fats couldn?t make a shot like that. How about I save the ammo?

11520:
Anybody think I should be saving some of this blood that?s squirting out of me here?

12000:
I need to check the insides of my eyelids for cracks. Just gimme a little while.

12480:
I gotta catch my breath. Anybody got a stronger smoke?

12960:
BANG BABY!

13440:
How many of these big assed roach motel refugees can there be?

13920:
I?m about to make Gumpy cast a polka dot shadow real quick like here, Keep him away from me.

14400:
If I ghost Fidel?s punk ass, do you think anybody in the real world will care?

14880:
You don?t mean to tell me you couldn?t get somebody better than Gus to work with us, could you?

15360:
Your punk ass had it coming, Mike.

15840:
Ooh, yummy, just like mom used to make.

16320:
I?m not afraid of ANYTHING! Well maybe AIDS.

16800:
Do you have something hard for me to do now?

17280:
You ARE kidding me, right?

17760:
Bye, Dee. I guess this means no Christmas card, huh?

18240:
Just call me the Ex Terminator. I?ll be back.

18720:
I just have to ask Gumpy; did the aliens forget to remove the anal probe?

19200:
I?m telling you, it?s gonna take more money than this to make me like this shit.

19680:
Is it time for my medication, or yours?

20160:
INCOMING!

20640:
Where?d we get this shit, at the local Flea Market?

21120:
I really miss going down by the Elementary School to watch the kids yell and run. You know, ?cause they don?t know the gun is loaded with blanks.

21600:
I only really hate two kinds of people. Prejudiced people and those DAMN ESKIMOS! 

22080:
I have to say I think I?m getting better at this shit.

22560:
Yeah; OK; Right.

23040:
You have any other bright ideas there, Einstein?

23520:
Working with Fidel is as pleasant as a fart in a space suit.

24000:
Gee, Gus could be like a friendly fire casualty out here.

24480:
Damn, Fox that ROCKED!

24960:
Do it again Buzz, do it again!

25440:
I always knew you were cut out for this, Ayanna.

25920:
Why do right now what I can put off until later?

26400:
Hey look, my favorite asshole! You get to die now dipshit.

26880:
If I could see it, I?d shoot it. Don?t get your hopes up.

27360:
Piss me off!

27840:
That?s why Buzz and I get along. Neither one of us are afraid of the taste or sight of blood.

28320:
Finally, a stand up firefight and not some run and hide bullshit.

28800:
There are still some Pansy Asses hiding here somewhere.

29280:
Oh yeah baby, I?ll get some good use out of this!

29760:
Now that was cool!

30240:
Isn?t that the kid that lady said she wanted us to look for?

30720:
Well Miguel, does Howdy Doody have wooden balls?

31200:
I think it's brewski time!

31680:
Lucy, I thin you got some ?splainin? to do!

32160:
I wasn?t going to jump in the sack with her and she didn?t smell like a T-bone so she had to die! 

32640:
Now that is a giant pussy!

33120:
Ask not, what your country can do for you. Ask how many zeros are on the paycheck!

33600:
Those damn pussies hauled ass on us. Are we taking out after them?

34080:
I could use some shut and a round eye to wrap my leg around. What do you say?

34560:
I?m up. I?M UP!

35040:
YEAH, what he said!

35520:
Why are we even trying to use this crap?

36000:
I think we have a real nasty surprise here.

36480:
Don?t even freaking breathe in this direction.

36960:
I?m taking on water like a U-boat.
