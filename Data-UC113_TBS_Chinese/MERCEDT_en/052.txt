0:
Target in sight.

480:
We have some inconveniences to dispose of.

960:
Serious snafu here!

1440:
Sushi!

1920:
That's one badass piece of sushi.

2400:
Got a feeling those things did some slicing of their own here.

2880:
Think I heard a suspicious sound.

3360:
Ugh, pretty rank. Smells like putrid sushi.

3840:
Something's out there, man. Something's watching us.

4320:
I never cared for those things. And trust me, they're around.

4800:
God damn, I need backup.

5280:
What's there?

5760:
Might be worth a look.

6240:
No more ammo.

6720:
Took it hard this time...may not walk away from this one.

7200:


7680:


8160:


8640:
Sorry, come again? I was spaced.

9120:
Gotta jammed gun here, damnit.

9600:
They're turnin' up the heat!

10080:
Sort of feel like a mosquito that's been slapped.

10560:
Comes with the territory.

11040:
Need a better vantage point.

11520:
Got a bad puncture wound here. Losing blood.

12000:
Hittin' a wall here. Gotta sleep.

12480:
I...I have to slow down.

12960:
Target dispatched.

13440:
Eat it raw!

13920:


14400:


14880:


15360:


15840:
Someone took a little too much off the top.

16320:


16800:
I'm all done.

17280:
No, with all due respect.

17760:
Our main target has been dispatched.

18240:
YES!! I mean...just doing my job.

18720:
One of those mercs we could do much better without.

19200:
I expected things to go better than this.

19680:
Some people should wise up and realize that mercenary work isn't for everybody.

20160:
Air raid! This is not a drill!

20640:
This equipment is trash. Should probably just put it out on the curb.

21120:


21600:


22080:
I do what I can.

22560:
I think we might want to go over that again.

23040:
That was a predictable outcome.

23520:


24000:


24480:


24960:


25440:


25920:


26400:
Don't look like we were spotted comin' in. Now we gotta find this guy.

26880:
This better pass quick...I can't focus on a damn thing.

27360:
I'll never get that.

27840:
You meet all kinds. Some of them actually turn out to be worth meeting.

28320:
Heads up. We have a confirmed enemy presence.

28800:
They probably haven't strayed too far...

29280:


29760:
It gets the job done.

30240:
Hey, that's that Graham kid.

30720:
We're here to prevent that. And we got access to the firepower to do it.

31200:
That's it for targets! At least for this area.

31680:
Hm. Perhaps we should take a closer look at who we deal with. They're skimming off the top.

32160:
I'm surprised to hear myself say it, but sometimes there don't seem to be enough bullets... A lot of mothers are gonna be spending more time with their kids.

32640:
Bobcat!

33120:
Well, we've been in this thing together since the beginning. Been a lot of water under the bridge. Feels like a long time ago. Hell... I almost feel like you gave birth to me. Thanks.

33600:
Ah, they took the back door. No one here but us, now.

34080:
Taking a rest before I do something foolish. Up in a bit.

34560:
Up and back on track now.

35040:
Same here.

35520:
This thing belongs in the nearest trash can.

36000:
Damn! Looks like we got a problem here.

36480:
Stay still! See that? Looks suspicious to me.

36960:
Hey... there's a un..<gulb... un...<gulb... under...<glub... tow... <glub here!

37440:
Made it intact.
