Threat!

480:
It's show time.

960:
They're on me.

2880:
Something's moving.

3840:
Something's in the air. I know it.

5280:
See something.

5760:
Stuff.

6240:
Gun's tapped out.

6720:
Got... hit... bad! Ain't looking good.

8640:
Didn't quite catch that?

9120:
Squat! Weapon won't fire.

10080:
I'm still here!

10560:
One of these days..my luck's gonna run out.

11040:
No way. Can't make that shot.

11520:
Took one. Need a patch.

12000:
Ahh.. About time for beddy-byes.

12480:
Need... air!

12960:
Annihilated.

15840:
Musta been a ten foot spray on that.

16800:
Done! What next?

17280:
Not gonna happen!

18720:
Somebody needs their butt kicked.

19200:
This ain't going very well...

19680:
We stick with it, we'll get it done.

20160:
Bombers!

20640:
Gotta get our hands on some better equipment. It's embarrassing to be seen with this stuff.

22080:
I noticed improvement.

22560:
Probably wanna rethink that.

23040:
Figured as much.

26880:
Think my corneas got scorched.

27360:
Getting discouraged. Wasting my time.

27840:
Seemed alright.

28320:
We got work to do. There's enemies.

28800:
We didn't finish the job. Stay awake.

29760:
It's a dog-eat-dog world!

31200:
Think we're alone.

32640:
Eyeing a savage cat.

33120:
To be honest, I wasn't sure about this place when I got here, but my little romp through the Tracona countryside turned out to be a rather pleasurable experience. I'd do it again.

33600:
Squat! They bugged out.

34080:
Catching shut-eye before I fall over.

34560:
Better now. Wide awake.

35040:
Put me down, too!

35520:
Fine time for this to be on the fritz.

36000:
Got too many parts. It's rigged.

36480:
Don't look right around here.

37440:
Got here. Need a game plan.

37920:
Laptop's happening. We're plugged in.

38400:
Man. My neck is stiff.

38880:
DON'T GLIDE is a bit of an understatement.

39360:
Ain't safe staying here too long.

39840:
No way out up here. Gotta do something about that door.

40320:
There's no turning back now. I'm seeing this through.

40800:
Should be wearing a parka. What's the deal with that anyway?

41280:
Found the nest. I say, let's do it.

41760:
Ain't gonna find a fast-food joint around here.

42240:
It's good to be out of the snow, but it looks like it's gonna be awhile before I feel my fingers again.

42720:
We're missing bodies. Didn't all get through.

43200:
Better lock and load. After a blast like that, I'm sure they're doing the same.

43680:
I count everyone as being here. Good.

44160:
You gotta know she's the only store in town.

44640:
An savory, yet necessary fellow.

45120:
Let me get right to the point!

45600:
Never thought I'd run into an Eskimo down here.

46080:
Don't know much about Arulco, Manuel, but I figure Tracona's gonna have some scar tissue before I leave here.

46560:
Keep a lid on it, Colonel... And remember... you're working with us now.

47040:
Stay close, John. Don't want to lose you too early.

47520:
You aren't gonna get us killed, are you Tex?

48000:
Something new to try.

48480:
Going through that fan's gotta be one of the most foolish things I ever considered actually doing.

48960:
He won't be bothering anybody anymore.

49440:
Let me check out that paper.

49920:
Never seen nothing quite like that... Doubt I ever will. Kinda heartwarming actually.

50400:
Something tells me we're gonna be seeing resistance from here on in.

50880:
Used to own one of these. A hand mortar. Got a few bucks for it, too.

51360:
Think that was the last of 'em. None to soon, either.

51840:
He was right. We won't be threatening him anymore.

52320:
Oh, man... He blew everything...

52800:
Wire cutters would have been nice. Guess I'll have to force it and let everyone know exactly where we are.

53280:
Now that's what I call a door!

53760:
Heard something move below us.

54240:
What's up with that?

54720:
We're being paged. Our fan's awaiting.

55200:
They were gonna blow the crap out of Arulco alright. Paper's got the missile coordinates for almost every town. Even got the coordinates for this place...

55680:
Hey... I got an idea. I just gotta change a few things on the control panel and hustle it into the elevator when I'm finished. Then, I can step back and enjoy the show.
