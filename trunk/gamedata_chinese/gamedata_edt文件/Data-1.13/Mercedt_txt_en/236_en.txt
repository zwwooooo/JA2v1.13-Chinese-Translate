What are you?

3360:
Bogie sighted!

Watch for anything jutting out of the ground!

4320:
It goes against my grain, but...

4800:
Multiple bogies present!

5280:
Something here!

5760:
Something here!

6240:
Need to be resupplied with ammunition.

6720:
I'm in dire need of...of medical attention. I... I'm unable to move!

7200:
With Bud's passing, the military community has suffered an undeniable loss.

9120:
My gun has jammed!

9600:
Beeing fired at!

10080:
Blood is flowing out of my wounds.

10560:
You can be court-martialed for that soldier!

11040:
I wish it was possible.

Request assistance.

I'm wiped!

Sined em out!

13440:
Sined em out!

13920:
I'd drop the gaffer in a minute. Sam Garver's been a thorn in my side for years.

15360:
An overwhelming success!

15840:
A godsend...

16320:
You won't be commanding me, Commander.

16800:
Objective accomplished!

17280:
I respectfully refuse!

17760:
An overwhelming success!

18240:
An overwhelming success!

18720:
This is going nowhere fast!

19200:
If I was working for you, soldier, I'd be A.-FRIGGIN'-W.O.L.

19680:
Where were you assigned before soldier? The motor pool?

20160:
You're nowhere close to snuff, soldier!

20640:
Not while in uniform, soldier!

22080:
Primo performance, soldier!

22560:
Tactical error.

23040:
Tactical error.

23520:
It's that stick-in-the-mud Garver!

24480:
I've always gotten along really well with Bud... 

25920:
It might be best to remember you're not the only job on the block.

26400:
Bogie sighted!

26880:
Taking heat!

27360:
Unfortunately, it looks easier than it is!

27840:
It seems I might have been too quick to judge you...

28320:
Watch for anything jutting out of the ground!

28800:
It's an affirmative, Commander! Let's get down to it!

29760:
Sined em out!

31200:
Pleased to report a change in sector status. This one is ours now!

32160:
An overwhelming success!

32640:
A godsend...

33120:
This is definitely one of my proudest victories!

33600:
We downed that entire squad!

34080:
I'm wiped!

34560:
Let's get to it!

35520:
This is no longer functional.

36000:
Boobytrap! I think I can disable it.

36480:
Beware! Things don't look right around here!

36960:
Can't keep my he...ad above water... much longer!

37440:
We are at the turning point, soldier! Its time to bring it on!

38400:
Not right now! Give me some time to run a background check on you.

38880:
Your offer doesn't appeal to me! You've had some trouble the past couple of days. I've got no time for losers!

39360:
Get the cash together and come back and see me.

39840:
That's it for me! You don't appear to be interested in accomplishing objectives.

40320:
As of yet, no one has returned my calls. As soon as I can gather some detailed info on you, I'll listen to your offer!

40800:
The bonuses are even, we'll have to try one more time, Commander.

41280:
I don't work with Sam Garver... And I never will! Fire him, or I quit!

42720:
I can't say I'm not disappointed, however the length of the assignment was adequate, and rotation is part and parcel of this business.

43200:
It be great to work for you, Commander. I should be in a position to accept the assignment shortly.

43680:
I'm in your squad, Commander!

44160:
Although I have my doubts about you, Lieutenant Bud Hellar is an exemplary soldier and a gentleman. It would be privilege to serve with him.

45600:
I have to leave! I've been subpoenaed to testify before your war crimes tribunal. I still find it hard to believe that so many of your men have died!

46080:
I repeat...

46560:
Get the cash together and come back and see me.

47040:
I got pressing business to attend to. I have to leave.

47520:
Forget it! Your butt's on the line! We're talking war crimes! We're talking far too many men leaving their hopes and dreams on your battlefield, BUDDY!

48000:
Not as long as you've got that old fart, Sam Garver, working for you. I can't stand him!

49440:
Bud Hellar was willing to put it all on the line for you.

50880:
I repeat...

51360:
Get the cash together and come back and see me.

51840:
I know I can fulfill your needs, Commander. How many other Captains did you notice in the lineup?

52320:
Ya, sure I will! And Saddam wants to be an American some day!

52800:
Yep... I've been up to seven Gees. Which sounds impressive until you've seen Lt. Commander Iggy Turner suck on a Marlboro at six.

53280:
You've acquired excellent value for the buck, Commander.

53760:
I'm not in a position to accept your proposal at face value. I have variety of offers, Commander, and I'm asking all potentials for a signing bonus.

55200:
And, in case you've forgotten, I've already bargained my way around the block with you, Commander. And we won't be doing it again!

55680:
You will mention in my file that I was let go for purely economic reasons!
