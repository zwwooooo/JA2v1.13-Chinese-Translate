Ah, hello, I'm Martha Stolitz.

480:
Please take a seat. Would you like tea and buscuits? Baked them myself, you know.

960:
I wonder if I could ask for a favor? My son Joey left home months ago, and I've had no word from him since. Here's his photo. Would you keep an eye out for him?

1440:
If you meet Joey, please try to bring him home. He left without his warm socks. Heaven knows what state he's in!

1920:
Oh, goodness no, what could I do with that? No, no, you keep it.

2400:
The news reports of subway gangs running amok are very disturbing, wouldn't you agree? What sort of person would join a gang?

2880:
OOOOhhhhh! I'm a defenseless old lady! You wouldn't hurt me, would you?

3360:
Me, become a mercenary?!? Mercy me, no, I couldn't do that!

3840:
I have an injury. Could you help me with first aid, or call a doctor?

4320:
If you find Joey, please bring him home, his father and I have been worried sick since he left!

4800:
Quick, hide under the bed, somebody's shooting!

5280:
You're back, Joey! What's that, you're a drug addict?!? Joey, how could you!

5760:
You what, you've been robbing people in subways?

6240:
You changed your name to Bruno because you were ashamed of me and your father?

6720:
You did what, you stole a motorcyle? Joey, how could you!

7200:
Your girlfriend is pregnant... but that's no problem since she was shot trying to knife someone! AAARRRRGGGGHHHH! Joey, what else have you been involved in?

7680:
I always wanted to carve someone up. You're the lucky one, my friend!

8160:
You have your own gang called Satan's Sons! The ones shown on television? Joey, how could you... AAARRRGGGHHHH!

8640:
If I had a gun I'd shoot you right now, Joey. You're just using up decent peoples air!

9120:
How do you use one of these things? Do I pull here? Please, do everyone in Danubia a favor.
