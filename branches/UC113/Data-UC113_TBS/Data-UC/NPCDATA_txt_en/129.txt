Welcome to Adrian Ferry Terminal.

480:
Do you wish to reserve seats? There is a ferry to the Island twice a day.

960:
Sorry, you just missed the boat. Perhaps you would like to take our charter helicopter instead?

1440:
Talk to the pilot. He's in the compound outside, checking his machine.

1920:
I am not permitted to accept gifts or bribes. Company policy.

2400:
Passage to the Island costs $20 for each person, children half price. No animals allowed.

2880:
Take it easy, I only work here.

3360:
My life is full of excitement already. Only yesterday a ferry rammed the wharf!

3840:
Blood! Aarrrrggghh, I hate blood... I need a doctor.

4320:
If that's all you need, please stand aside. There are other customers waiting.

4800:
I'm sorry, but I'm too busy lying on the ground ducking bullets to talk right now.
