I'm Pablo Greco. I run cargo department at airport. You want something, you see me.

480:
You again.

960:
Ya... It's nice talking to you, but I got a lot of friends. What I never got enough of is spending money.

1440:
I never stop, I tell you. Pace around here would bury somebody like you.

1920:
I already got enough stuff to keep track of.

2400:
I really don't care who you are or why you're here.

2880:
Relax...

3360:
Nah...

3840:
It hurts... I fraggin' hurt.

4320:
I got a lot of work to do.

4800:
Coffee money. Help me keep my eyes open, if you know what I mean.

5280:
Well... Whatever you were expecting isn't here. Could try again tomorrow.

5760:
Ya... I got something for you.

6240:
A small package came in...uh, just hope I didn't misplace it somewhere...

6720:
If I remember right, it was a decent size, too...

7200:
Oh, it's fraggin' heavy, too. Nearly pulled out my back. You movin' down here or something?

7680:
And, ah... In case you're not aware, I'm, ah... we're not responsible for anything that might be missing.

8160:
It wasn't me, man, I swear.

8640:
You don't scare me. I don't care what you do to me. I don't know nothing about your missing stuff.

9120:
Okay, don't go crazy on me. I'll see what I can do... I'll ask around. But I'll need time. Uh, maybe you can come back tomorrow.

9600:
I have good news for you. It wasn't easy, but I managed to find your missing stuff. Even threw in a couple of extra things I found lying around just to make up for the inconvenience.

10080:
A lot of people come in and out of here, you know. I can't be babysitting your shipments. Well, at least not for free.

10560:
Ah, thank you for your help.

11040:
Take care of the fighting, then I take care of you.

11520:
Personally, I don't care who wins the war. I just don't want no more shooting near the airport.

12000:
We, uh, have a problem with your shipment. I wasn't here, you understand, but when the plane landed, some people would not let your stuff be unloaded. The pilot left with your goods still on the plane.

12480:
What is wrong with you!
