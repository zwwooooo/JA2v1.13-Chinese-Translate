Detective Bronski, Port Kip police. How can I help you?

480:
You have that guilty look on your face. Are you involved in something criminal?

960:
Adrian police been having a very hectic week. Just caught someone breaking into the Crepaton Corporation head office!

1440:
Port Kip is normally a quiet town. My men soon control any disturbances. Got problems in the subway, though.

1920:
I don't need something like that, but new batteries for my cattle prod would be welcome.

2400:
I'm really busy interrogating this reporter floozie Miranda Cruz. Very stubborn, refuses to talk.

2880:
I've been itching to try out my rubber hose. Keep this up and you'll be sorry!

3360:
I'm a corrupt cop raking in substantial amounts of protection money and payoffs. Why would I leave that?

3840:
Officer down! Help! Help!

4320:
Must leave you in Officer Plodski's capable hands. Got some serious interrogation work ahead of me.

4800:
Hit the floor boys, someone's shooting up the police station! Quick, call for backup!

5280:
Sending Miranda here for questioning shows how much headquarters values my techniques. I'm gonna get the truth out of her...

5760:
Crepaton is pretty anxious to get back some missing documents they reckon Miranda stole. Hmmmm... Wonder what sorta stuff is in them?

6240:
If you spot a guy named Postie anywhere, turn him in. Dangerous escaped psychopath.

6720:
Satan's Sons are causing havoc in our subways. I'm gonna throw one of those creeps under a train during rush hour as an example!

7200:
Yeah, that should keep the metro people happy. Might even get a reward or commendation from headquarters!

7680:
I'm gonna shove my baton where the sun don't shine!
