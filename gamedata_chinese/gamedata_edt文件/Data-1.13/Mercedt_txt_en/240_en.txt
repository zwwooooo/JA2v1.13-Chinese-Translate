Obviously, someone has been digging around here!

I don't feel good about this.

Better keep my eyes open.

Better keep my eyes open.

4800:
It's too bad...

5280:
I can see something.

5760:
I can see something.

6240:
I need a resupply of ammo, pronto.

6720:
I can't take the pain...

7200:
It just won't be the same without Bob.

9120:
My gun won't fire!

9600:
They're shooting at me!

10080:
I'm getting nailed!

Maybe there's a position for you at the PX.

I'd like to have a better position.

With plesure!

15360:
We've eliminated that platoon!

15840:
I don't feel good about this.

16320:
It's too bad. I had thought the course was ending today...

16800:
The credit's all yours, sir!

17280:
That would be highly irregular.

18240:
With plesure!

19200:
My what a fine example of uninspired leadership.

19680:
And just what military academy were you thrown out of?

20640:
It doesn't want to work!

22080:
I was always good at picking the right commander.

22560:
The mission has become impossible!

23040:
The mission has become impossible!

24480:
Bob's a good friend and a war hero

25920:
We're running out of time, sir!

26400:
It's too bad...

27360:
I'm sorry, but I'm not normally asked to work with my hands!

28320:
I can feel it in the air. It's going to blow wide-open any minute!

28800:
Consider it taken care of...

29760:
Excellent command, sir!

31200:
Mission successful!

32160:
With plesure!

32640:
I don't feel good about this.

33120:
Mission successful!

33600:
Consider it taken care of...

35040:
I'm sure I did it by the book...

35520:
It doesn't want to work!

36000:
I think it's rigged.

36480:
I think it's rigged.

36960:
I've got to...rest. Can't keep swimming much longer...

37440:
I'm slightly unclear about the best direction.

38400:
I won't be joining your team. You just didn't seem to want me bad enough.

38880:
I've been thinking about it. If I accepted, Bob would be really put off, and I can't allow that to happen.

39360:
I'm not interested. I've already worked for you, and it didn't take long for you to fire me.

39840:
You guys are trying to make it difficult... You'll have to make another offer and hopefully this time they won't all be the same.

40320:
I'll tell you what's going on. Just remember you heard it from me first...

40800:
I'm glad I could be of assistance. Good luck!

42720:
We're running out of time, sir!

43200:
Now that it's decided... It's time to get to work.

43680:
Now that it's decided... It's time to get to work.

44160:
Bob's a good friend and a war hero to boot!

45600:
I've been thinking about it. If I accepted, Bob would be really put off, and I can't allow that to happen.

46080:
Once again...

46560:
Where were you planning on getting the money?

47040:
This is what I get! After all the things I was willing to do for you! You're just going to toss me away like I was disposable?

47520:
I've been thinking about it. If I accepted, Bob would be really put off, and I can't allow that to happen.

49440:
I was hoping for a little more... Bob and I are really close, and I'd really like to be able to justify accepting your offer.

50880:
Once again...

51360:
Where were you planning on getting the money?

51840:
I've got a military background, a list of references, a complete library of modern combat tactics, and I'll stir your coffee if you ask me.

52320:
Hey... I'm a married man!

52800:
Did you hear about Lynx and Buzz? Well... Keep it a secret, but I hear church bells in the distance...

53280:
I'll go! If there's anything you need or anything I can do for you, you just let me know!

53760:
I hope you understand it was nothing personal

55200:
I can't help you out... I'm in training with the special forces.

55680:
I just had a feeling... I guess the best way to decide which offer I should take would be a...the biggest signing bonus.
