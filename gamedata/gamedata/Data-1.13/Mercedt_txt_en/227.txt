I've come across an enemy.

480:
I've come across an enemy. I don't think I've been noticed.

960:
I'm risking my life for this! There better be something in it for me.

1440:
Holy cow!

1920:
Holy cow!

2400:
I feel nauseous...

2880:
And remember - if I hear anything, you'll know about it.

3360:
I'm getting a queasy feeling in my stomach. 

3840:
There's something about this area that doesn't seem right.

4320:
Do you think I should get any special health insurance? And what about vaccinations? What about those tropical malaria beetles?

4800:
I could get really hurt!

5280:
There's something useful here.

5760:
Finding this thing should keep people off my case for a bit.

6240:
I'm in danger! I need ammunition!

6720:
I'm dying. I'm... really... dying. Help!

7200:
Doctor Gloveless is dead? But... he's been taking care of me since I was nine!

8640:
My head is pounding away.

9120:
Now my gun won't work!

9600:
Oh God. I'm starting to feel sick. There's bullets flying everywhere!

10080:
My head is pounding away.

10560:
That was too close for comfort.

11040:
My view's obstructed.

11520:
Oh no - I'm bleeding! I'm gonna die!

12000:
I could use the rest of the day off.

12480:
I'm seeing double!

12960:
Prognosis... Poor.

13440:
Prognosis... Poor.

15360:
Looks like you could've use a couple of more doctors!

15840:
This is gonna make me sick.

16320:
I'm not feeling right.

16800:
It's looking really good!

17280:
I won't even consider it.

17760:
I'm shaking lika a leaf. But we did it! We should think about heading home.

18240:
I won't sleep tonight. I don't know if I'll ever sleep again! All I know is I got to get out of here!

18720:
I wanna hurt him real bad.

19200:
You don't show enough loyalty!

19680:
Won't put up with you stiffing people much longer.

20160:
Holy cow! I could get really hurt!

20640:
This is one sad piece of machinery. It ain't never gonna work!

21120:
Well... since you asked... I've just had a bad bout of something worse than I ever had before and they gave me wrong meds, which caused me to suffer further complications-

21600:
It's a scar! A fifteen three-quarter inch scar from the time I nearly died. Took a hundred and eighty three stitches. It brought me back twice.

22080:
You can't buy more loyalty for your dollar! Hurl E. Cutter - where the "E" stands for "exceptional value"!

22560:
That'd be insane!

23040:
This is disappointing. I thought we have a chance.

24480:
Doctor Gloveless has my full medical history. You get on the bad side of my doctor - you get on the bad side of me.

25920:
Hey! You still owe me money! If you think I'll work for you, you're crazy.

26400:
Please! Don't hurt me! I'll tell you where everyone is!

26880:
I... have something in my eye!

27360:
You're crazy!

27840:
I'll need to see your test results.

28320:
There's an enemy present!

28800:
Anyone still alive over there?

29280:
Finding this thing should keep people off my case for a bit.

29760:
I always wanted one of these!

30240:
Alright!

30720:
Why me? When you wanted to know something about the team - wasn't I willing to tell you?

31200:
Chalk one up for us!

31680:
That arms dealer pulled a fast one! We got third degree burned!

32160:
It's a shame... Oh well.

32640:
Holy cow!

33120:
I picked up an unfamiliar rash, but other than that, it wasn't too bad.

33600:
That's one less gang that can hurt me!

34080:
I haven't slept since I left. Not a wink!

34560:
I feel good. I'm ready!

35040:
I've already told you.

35520:
This is one sad piece of machinery. It ain't never gonna work!

36000:
I could lose a body part messing with this!

36480:
The earth looks pretty dug up around here.

36960:
Oh my God... I'm drowning... I'm gonna die...

37440:
We're going to have to make some decisions.
