3840:
I don't like how quiet it is, I be tellin' ya. It's like bein' in the eye of a hurricane, don't ya know.

4320:
I'm thinkin' we don't be alone here, man. I can feel the flamin' eyes of the Jabberwocks starin' at us.

4800:
Back off! Do I look like a bag of Jabberwock chow?

5280:
Somethin' be over there, man.

5760:

6240:
I got no more bullets in my gun.

6720:
Can there be pain worse than this?

8160:
Spider, you were all right. I'm so sorry we lost you, sister. So sorry...

8640:
I be losin' it, man.

9120:
This gun's out of order, man!

9600:
These lowlifes aren't givin' me a chance!

10080:
Dat be nothing, man... I don't bruise easily.

12480:
I can't catch my breath, man.

12960:
Hope it hurt!

13440:
I killed the Jabberwock!

14880:
I tell ya, man, that racist pig Gasket is getting under my skin. I be thinkin' of liposuctionin' him out.

15360:
Mike succumbs to the deadly Vicki! Now who be the number one merc, I ask ya?

15840:

18720:
What a waste of a brain, man.

19200:
I be losin' whatever faith I had in this miserable journey, man. I'm not a happy camper.

19680:
Most of the mercs on this team be lewd, crude, and rude, man. If I saw them on the sidewalk, I'd be crossin' the street to avoid them.

20160:
There be enemy aircraft, man!

20640:
All this equipment might be fine for Halloween costumes, but it be doing nothing for us!

21600:
Why there be so many beer-swillin', testosterone-soaked slobs in this business? It's gettin' so a woman can't go into combat without bein' hassled!

22080:
I'm not gettin' older, I'm gettin' better!

22560:
I can't believe there be no better way.

I can't believe we even tried that!

25440:
I'm so proud of Spider... Dat girl's got it.

25920:

26400:
Oh, holy smokes, man, we're up against Mike himself!

26880:
I no be seeing nothing, man.

27360:
I be blowin' my time, man.

27840:
Some people deserve better than to be livin' here...

28320:
It appears we have company in this area, man.

28800:
I wouldn't be gettin' too confident. We still have company.

29280:
Oh, man... Something so fine should come with a card.

30240:
That be the little dickens over there, man. I should drag him home by his nose.

30720:
She be removing nothin'! You hang tight, and let us do our work.

31200:
Yeah, man! That be the last of them.

31680:
Hey! Some stuff be missin' here. Someone be looking for trouble.

32160:
She asked for it. Did everything but say it out loud, man. This world is better off. Trust me.

32640:
Jungle cat!

33120:
Yeah man! We lined 'em up, and we took 'em down. I been at this a long time, and I never met people as good as you. You keep a line open. We be talking again, soon.

33600:
They be outta here like a '57 Chevy, man. Afraid of us, they be!

34080:

34560:
Ya. I be awake now, and back to work.

35040:

35520:

36000:
Relax... I think this be trapped.

36480:
Hmm... I don't be liking the looks of that.

36960:
The water... it's moving... fast. I be tiring...

37440:
I be standing where ya wanted me, man.

38400:
No thanks, man. If I be takin' a job with the likes of you, I'll never respect myself again!

38880:
No thanks, man. Around here, they call you the Merc Motel...'cuz Mercs check in, but they don't check out!

39360:
Sorry man, I be havin' my annual Midnight Madness Sale at the shop.

39840:
I'm sorry man, I've been looking forward to the Car Show all year. Tell me you need me as early as you can and I be tryin' to help you out.

40320:
This is Vicki Waters. I be either on assignment or at the shop. So, leave me your vitals, and I be getting back to you as soon as I can.

40800:
Thanks, man. It wasn't so bad. I don't know why someone started that rumor about you.

42240:
Sorry, man. I can't in good conscience be signin' with ya. Gasket is such a racist. I can't lay down my life for someone who'd just as soon like to kill me himself.

42720:
Say, man, my contract is almost up. Would you be wantin' to renew it?

43200:
Thanks man, I'll keep doing my best for you.

43680:
Thanks man, I'll show you how a real merc performs.

45120:
Well, I be tellin' ya, I've had better offers, but there's something about Spider that I be wanting to be workin' with her. I'll take the job, man.

45600:
No thanks, man. I don't think you know what you're doing out there. Maybe you should be pushin' pencils behind a big desk instead.

46080:
Did ya hear me, man? I was saying...

46560:
I hope you be havin' some extra money stashed away somewhere, 'cuz you don't have enough left in the bank.

47040:
I'll be on my way then. But I tell you, you are making a serious mistake. Mercs of my stripe are not easy to come by.

47520:
No thanks, man. Around here, they call you the Merc Motel...'cuz Mercs check in, but they don't check out!

48960:
Sorry, man, I can't in good conscience be signin' with ya. Gasket is such a racist. I can't lay down my life for someone who'd just as soon like to kill me himself.

50400:
Well, I be tellin' ya, I've had better offers, but there's something about Spider that I be wanting to be workin' with her. I'll take the job, man.

50880:
Did ya hear me, man? I was saying...

51360:
I hope you be havin' some extra money stashed away somewhere, 'cuz you don't have enough left in the bank.

51840:
Vicki Waters. Who I be speaking with?

52320:
You're not holding up your end of the conversation, man.

52800:
Come on, man, spit it out.

53280:
What kind of an arrangement did you have in mind?

53760:
You can always call me back when you have a clearer idea of what you want, but in the meantime, please don't waste my time.

55200:
Be lettin' you know, I be headin' off soon, man.

55680:
I be movin' up in the ranks, man. And my price be movin' with me.
