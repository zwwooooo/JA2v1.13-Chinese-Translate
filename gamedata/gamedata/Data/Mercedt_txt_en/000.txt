Have company!

480:
Ah, trouble is here!

960:
God, give me strength!

1440:
Another one of the nightmares is here.

1920:
Please, tell me I am just having nightmares.

2400:
Somebody was not so lucky here.

2880:
What was that?

3360:
This place has stench of the nightmares.

3840:
My bowels are clenching for no apparent reason.

4320:
This place feels full of nightmares.

4800:
So many nightmares! Lord, save me!

5280:
What is that?

5760:
Ah, look there!

6240:
Chamber of gun is empty.

6720:
I ask God not to let me die.

7200:
Red, I did not want to say goodbye to you. But at least you have died doing what you loved. That is most enviable.

8640:
Wait, I have...what is the expression? Cobwebs in the head?

9120:
This gun refuses to fire.

9600:
They are trying to kill me! But I am professional!

10080:
I hurt all over. Next time, I ask more money.

10560:
The Lord must have been with me.

11040:
I have no clear shot from here.

11520:
Oh...I hate the sight of my own blood.

12000:
I am spent now. I should rest.

12480:
I need to stop. My lungs are small.

12960:
Forgive me for taking life.

13440:
I enjoy killing these nightmares.

15360:
I have killed the great Mike! I do little dance of victory! Heyheyhey!

15840:
I have seen men die this way. It nauseates me.

16320:
I am like cat! The water...I no like to go in it.

16800:
All right, that is finished. I be ready.

17280:
I respectfully decline.

17760:
I dislike to take life. But this one invited death.

18240:
YES! I mean...killing is bad, but...YES! I am hero today!

18720:
Some persons it is difficult to respect.

19200:
This organization is phooey!

19680:
I have no choice but to trust these people with my life.

20160:
Attacking from above!

20640:
How can I be expected to do good work with equipment like this?

21600:
Women should be always treated respectfully, even in places like this.

22080:
Ah, there is hope for me yet.

22560:
I see great flaws in this plan.

23040:
That was easily anticipated.

24480:
That Red, he is some terrific, eh? And so colorful.

25920:
I do not want to make that commitment yet. We will see.

26400:
That is Mike? I do not understand how he can be such a traitor.

26880:
I am without vision.

27360:
I am having great difficulty. I am of no help.

27840:
He is a gentleman.

28320:
Enemy exists in region.

28800:
Forces are in hiding, but are still close.

29760:
Gun is dependable. I am very satisfied with gun.

30240:
Is that not boy, Joey Grey?

30720:
We are ready to undertake task at hand.

31200:
That is it! There is no more enemy.

31680:
This shipment is not complete. I am thinking of shooting gun.

32160:
I do not feel killing is always good. Yet, sometimes, it is necessary.

32640:
Budapest!

33120:
Hey hey! We are good! I am happy and pleasured to be a part of this success. Chances have been taken, and I have learned much.

33600:
The enemies have retreated from sector.

34080:
I do not work well without sleep. I will be just a moment.

34560:
I am awakened and active.

35040:
Include me on that.

35520:
This equipment is no longer in workable state.

36000:
Stand back. There is trap there I believe. Perhaps I get to work, no?

36480:
Caution. That looks highly dangerous to me.

36960:
Lord... <glub> why...

37440:
I have reached the destination now.

38400:
Others have warned me about you. I am not your man.

38880:
I love to play with bombs, but working with you is even too dangerous for me.

39360:
I am taking religious holiday. Perhaps another time.

39840:
I am giving lecture on mercury-switch timing devices. You must ask me sooner next time.

40320:
Hello. This is Barry's telephone response mechanism. I, Barry, am in lab at this moment. Tell me who you are, and I will respond in near future.

40800:
It is good I will have some time to play with new plastiques. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to have blown things up for you.

42720:
You'll see we have nearly reached the end of my contract. If I've pleased you, maybe we work out a new agreement, yes?

43200:
It is my privilege to continue our association.

43680:
We have reached simultaneous agreement. Count me as part of your team.

44160:
I am not sure about this, but Red has joined you. I like him. So, very well, I have deal.

45600:
No, I do not wish to continue. Perhaps I am not right for this kind of work. I find it saddening.

46080:
Pardon me, I said...

46560:
If you cannot afford to pay me, I cannot afford to work for you.

47040:
I would have liked more opportunity to prove myself to you. But it is as you wish. Goodbye.

47520:
I love to play with bombs, but working with you is even too dangerous for me.

49440:
I am not sure about this, but Red has joined you. I like him. So, very well, I have deal.

50880:
Pardon me, I said...

51360:
If you cannot afford to pay me, I cannot afford to work for you.

51840:
Hello. Barry Unger. What can be done for you?

52320:
I apologize, I sometimes have trouble with the language. You call me for purpose?

52800:
This is uncomfortable silence.

53280:
How long you want me to work?

53760:
Maybe we have phone problem. Try to call me back.

55200:
Contract time almost come over.

55680:
Skills improve, and so I must improve my price.
