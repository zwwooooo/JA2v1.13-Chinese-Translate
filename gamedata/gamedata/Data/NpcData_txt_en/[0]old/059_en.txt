I'm Ira. I came to Arulco five years ago as part of an effort to supply humanitarian aid. I soon realized the only aid they needed was in getting rid of Deidranna. By whichever means possible.

How's it going?

960:
The people's suffering is beyond comprehension.

1440:
The people of Arulco have forgotten what freedom is.

1920:
Keep it.

2400:
The rebel force is a dedicated one. Unfortunately, there are only a few of us left.

2880:
Such an attitude serves no purpose.

3360:
Sounds interesting, but I'm not sure of you.

3840:
I am in need of... medical attention.

4320:
I have nothing left to say.

4800:
She is evil. A driven bitch.

Miguel's rebel force has been together for almost two decades. They are trustworthy and loyal. They will accept you as one of their own as long as you do no harm.

5760:
All right. I could be of help with some of the ins and outs of this country and its people. But I must tell you... I'm not a professional like you guys.

6240:
I'm afraid my marksmanship is a little weak for a soldier. Miguel used me mostly as a medic and a look out. Anyways, I'm sure we'll make out okay. Let's get going... I'll lead the way.

6720:
You will pay for what you've done!

7200:
Hmm. Thanks.
