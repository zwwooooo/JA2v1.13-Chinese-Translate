0:
Got a sap!

480:
Looks like we're gonna be seeing some action, Ace.

960:
My nuts are in a vice, Ace!

1440:
Creature, Ace.

1920:
Now, what kind of a critter is that? It's the size of a freakin' Buick!

2400:
Maybe they're full now?

2880:
Caught some noise, Ace.

3360:
The place reeks of those freakin' creatures, Ace.

3840:
Something's gonna happen. I can feel it, Ace.

4320:
Here's hoping this excursion is bug-free, Ace.

4800:
They ain't lettin' up, Ace.

5280:
Look, Ace.

5760:
There's something.

6240:
Burned-up my ammo, Ace.

6720:
Don't worry about me, Ace. I'm just gonna lie here and bleed to death.

7200:
Grunty's gone? Freakin' tragic!

8160:
Oh, no...not Raven, Ace. Her and I had a future. Though she may not have known it yet.

8640:
I'm mixed up, Ace.

9120:
Damn! Jammed gun's dangerous, Ace.

9600:
Taking heavy fire, Ace.

10080:
I wasn't ready for that.

10560:
Freakin' lucky!

11040:
Attempting a shot like that would probably be a waste of time, Ace.

11520:
I need some gauze.

12000:
Put in a hell of a shift. Due for some for R & R, Ace.

12480:
I gotta get into better shape, or retire.

12960:
Be sure to write!

13440:
Exterminated!

14880:
How does a squirrel-faced pinhead like that end up landing a babe like Raven? Don't seem right, Ace.

15360:
Comes with the territory. Mike knew that!

15840:
Ya ain't been in combat, Ace, 'til ya pulled an eyeball out of your pocket.

16320:
Not crazy about water, Ace. Unless it's bottled up or in a bathtub.

16800:
Ready, Ace.

17280:
Maybe another time, Ace.

17760:
She was a real piece of work. Now, she's just a piece of meat.

18240:
I have to tell ya, Ace... That was a hell of a lot more fun than just spraying the place.

18720:
Nimrod...

19200:
This little adventure is turning sour, Ace. And fast!

19680:
Unless we get a few more professionals down here pronto, this operation is in the toilet.

20160:
Keep your heads down and your butts covered! They're comin' in from above!

20640:
How's about spending some dough, Ace, and gettin' me some equipment that was actually made in this century.

21120:
Kinda wish we weren't in the middle of a war, Ace. Wouldn't mind taking in some of the country and spending some time with the locals.

22080:
I still got a few things to learn.

22560:
Think it out, Ace.

23040:
Prop me up, Ace. I can't believe it turned out that way.

24480:
That Grunty's a firestorm, Ace.

25440:
That's one talented babe.

25920:
Sit on it a bit, Ace. We'll talk later.

26400:
I knew Mike had some long-term things going. Didn't expect to see him working for her though.

26880:
I can't see a freakin' thing, Ace!

27360:
I could try this forever, Ace.

27840:
There are some friendly people down here, huh Ace?

28320:
Sector's occupied by saps, Ace. Maybe we should fire off a couple of rounds just to let 'em know they're gonna die.

28800:
Gettin' to be a drag chasin' 'em, Ace. We go about our business, they'll probably show.

29280:
Lookee here, Ace. Jackpot!

30240:
I think I spotted Joey on the runaway, Ace.

30720:
Good to be here, Ace. You can count this one as already in the bag. She's gonna wish she was a housewife.

31200:
We're all clear, Ace.

31680:
This ain't everything we ordered!

32160:
It's people like her that give target practice new meaning, Ace. I mean, it was necessary, you know? Ask me, I don't think there was another way to deal with her.

32640:
Freakin' furball!

33120:
That's how to win 'em, Ace! Now that Arulco is clear, I think I might spend me some time with the locals, get a tan, do some R & R. I knew we could do it.

33600:
They couldn't take the heat, so they got outta the kitchen. Just us here now, Ace.

34080:
Taking some R & R, Ace. I'm getting cloudy here.

34560:
That's the ticket. I'm up and at 'em.

35040:
Hey, Ace! Sign me up, too!

35520:
Warranty musta expired on this thing. That's when they break.

36000:
Whoa. Sit tight...this is rigged.

36480:
Hmm. Looks dangerous, Ace.

36960:
You know I... hate... water..., Ace.

37440:
Like, I'm there, Ace.

38400:
Heard plenty of things about you, and none of them good, Ace. Gonna have to pass.

38880:
Don't look like anybody leaves here alive, does it, Ace. Been around too long to take a chance on one-sided odds.

39360:
Bad timing, Ace, got a rendez-vous with my dietician.

39840:
Gotta leave, Ace. Give me a bit a time. You never know, I could be back for the final sweep and the victory bash.

40320:
Hitman Hennessy, mercenary for hire! You caught me out and about, Ace. So, leave me a couple of details, and I'll call ya back when I get in. Have a good one.

40800:
It was a good stint, Ace. We'll be talking.

42240:
Don't ever want to find myself working with Raider again, Ace. Still can't figure out how this guy bagged Raven. Maybe she drinks?

42720:
Time's a tickin', Ace... You thinking about keeping me around?

43200:
Good news, Ace. I was in no rush to leave. We got work to do.

43680:
Count me in, Ace.

44160:
Sure, Ace. Grunty's the key to a solid operation. It's a pleasure to work with him.

45120:
Ya bet, Ace. With bait like Raven, how's a man to say no? Just stay a little more on top of things from here on in.

45600:
It's been a long haul, Ace. Think I'm gonna go back to my condo and forget all about you and this God forsaken country.

46080:
I was saying, Ace...

46560:
You got money problems, Ace. It's too bad, but I got to survive.

47040:
You sure you're not being a bit premature here, Ace?

47520:
Don't look like anybody leaves here alive, does it, Ace. Been around too long to take a chance on one-sided odds.

48000:
Don't ever want to find myself working with Raider again, Ace. Still can't figure out how this guy bagged Raven. Maybe she drinks?

48480:
Time's a tickin', Ace... You thinking about keeping me around?

48960:
Don't ever want to find myself working with Raider again, Ace. Still can't figure out how this guy bagged Raven. Maybe she drinks?

49440:
Sure, Ace. Grunty's the key to a solid operation. It's a pleasure to work with him.

50400:
Ya bet, Ace. With bait like Raven, how's a man to say no? Just stay a little more on top of things from here on in.

50880:
I was saying, Ace...

51360:
You got money problems, Ace. It's too bad, but I got to survive.

51840:
Hello, Ace...You're talking to Hitman Hennessy, mercenary for hire.

52320:
Don't believe everything ya read, Ace. I've never felt better.

52800:
Is this gonna be a while, Ace?

53280:
How big a bag am I packing?

53760:
Gotta run, Ace! I left something on the stove!

55200:
Almost time for me to say goodbye, Ace.

55680:
Moving up in the world, Ace. And my rates are moving right up along with me.
