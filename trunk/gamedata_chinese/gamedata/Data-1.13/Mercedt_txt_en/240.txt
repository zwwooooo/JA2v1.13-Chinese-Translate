1920:
I really don't wanna get on his bad side.

2400:
I've been in this situation before, things don't feel right around here.

2880:
I don't feel good about this.

3360:
I don't feel good about this.

3840:
Better keep my eyes open.

4320:
Better keep my eyes open.

4800:
Consider it taken care of.

5280:
I can see something.

5760:
I can see something.

6240:
I need a resupply of ammo, pronto.

6720:
I can't take the pain...

7200:
It just won't be the same without Bob.

8640:
I'm slightly unclear about the best direction.

9120:
My gun won't fire!

9600:
They're shooting at me!

10080:
I'm getting nailed!

10560:
Maybe there's a position for you at the PX!

11040:
I'd like to have a better position.

11520:
Request medical attention.

12000:
I'm drained...

12480:
I'm drained...

12960:
It's about time!

13440:
It's about time!

13920:
That gasbag, Shudlem, should have stuck to delivering babies!

15360:
I hope you understand it was nothing personal.

15840:
This is disgusting!

16320:
It's too bad. I had thought the course was ending today...

16800:
I'm sure I did it by the book.

17280:
Obviously, that isn't going to happen.

17760:
Excellent command, sir!

18240:
We have to consider establishing a route back to the compound.

18720:
That hustler pulled the wool over our eyes!

19200:
My, what a fine example of uninspired leadership.

19680:
And just what military academy were you thrown out of?

20160:
It's a trap! Let's get outta here!

20640:
It doesn't want to work!

21120:
Hey... I'm a married man!

21600:
I'll tell you what's going on. Just remember you heard it from me first...

22080:
I was always good at picking the right commander!

22560:
That would be highly irregular.

23040:
The mission has become impossible!

23520:
I can't believe my luck, sir. I've located Mitch Shudlem.

24480:
Bob's a good friend and a war hero.

25920:
We're running out of time, sir!

26400:
It's too bad...

26880:
Hey! What about me?

27360:
I'm sorry, but I'm not normally asked to work with my hands!

27840:
Just a guy trying to make a living.

28320:
I can feel it in the air. It's going to blow wide-open any minute!

28800:
You guys are trying to make it difficult.

29760:
The credit's all yours, sir!

30240:
That hustler must be juiced good.

30720:
You can mark me down as being definitely interested.

31200:
We've eliminated that platoon!

31680:
Talk about being lowballed!

32160:
I hope you understand it was nothing personal.

32640:
I don't feel good about this.

33120:
Mission successful!

33600:
Operation successful. Sector secure.

34080:
I'm drained...

34560:
Time to get to work.

35040:
Hey! What about me?

35520:
It doesn't want to work!

36000:
I think it's rigged.

36480:
Obviously, someone has been digging around here.

36960:
I've got to... rest. Can't keep swimming much longer...

37440:
We're at the midpoint of the mission, sir!

38400:
You can mark me down as being definitely interested. However, I'm in no rush to close the door on any other offers.

38880:
Had family, you know. Out of respect to them, there's no way I would work for you.

39360:
I'm not interested. I've already worked for you, and it didn't take long for you to fire me.

39840:
I can't help you out. I'm in training with the special forces.

40320:
I'll tell you what's going on. Just remember you heard it from me first...

40800:
I'm glad I could be of assistance. Good luck!

41280:
Anyone na?ve enough to have Mitch Shudlem on their team doesn't deserve me.

42720:
We're running out of time, sir!

43200:
Ah, of course I'll continue to work for you.

43680:
Now that it's decided, it's time to get to work.

44160:
Bob's a good friend and a war hero to boot!

45600:
I won't be joining your team. You just didn't seem to want me bad enough.

46080:
Once again...

46560:
Where were you planning on getting the money?

47040:
This is what I get! After all the things I was willing to do for you! You're just going to toss me away like I was disposable?

47520:
...and a mother, and, ah, nevermind. Just don't look for me, 'cause I won't be here.

48000:
Make a decision. It's Mitch Shudlem or me, but this unit ain't big enough for both of us.

49440:
I was hoping for a little more... Bob and I are really close, and I'd really like to be able to justify accepting your offer.

50880:
Once again...

51360:
Where were you planning on getting the money?

51840:
I've got a military background, a list of references, a complete library of modern combat tactics, and I'll stir your coffee if you ask me.

52320:
Hey... I'm a married man!

52800:
Did you hear about Lynx and Buzz? Well... Keep it a secret, but I hear church bells in the distance...

53280:
Sure I'll go! If there's anything you need or anything I can do for you, you just let me know!

53760:
I don't expect to be changing my mind about you any time soon.

54240:
That gasbag, Shudlem, should have stuck to delivering babies!

55200:
I can't help you out... I'm in training with the special forces.

55680:
I just had a feeling... I guess the best way to decide which offer I should take would be a... the biggest signing bonus.
