Doctor Vincent Beaumont. Pleasure to meet ya.

480:
What can I do to help ya?

960:
Until you guys came down here, I had given up on this country. The only reason I'm still here is I couldn't turn my back on its people.

1440:
You guys are nothing short of heroes.

1920:
You keep it.

2400:
You wouldn't believe what Deidranna's put these people through. Most of them are probably far too scared to tell ya. They desperately want to believe in ya.

2880:
Why the attitude? There's no reason for it.

3360:
I have my concerns about you. It's nothin' uh, personal, of course.

3840:
Ughhh - I'm hemorrhaging... Uhh - I'm weak...

4320:
Don't mean to brush ya off, but I have to.

4800:
It will help keep things going around here.

5280:
Just the one wounded? That shouldn't pose any problems.

5760:
Looks like I have a full slate ahead of me today.

6240:
Though I hate to do this, I will have to charge you for any medical services rendered. Otherwise, we couldn't keep this place open.

6720:
I'll cut you a little bit of a break on the price. I wouldn't feel right otherwise.

7200:
Since you guys are for real, I'll only charge you for the cost of the supplies.

7680:
You guys are out there putting it on the line for us. The least we can do is give ya a freebie this time.

8160:
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to charge you for use of our services.

8640:
Ya got to promise me you won't tell anyone... I really appreciate what you're doing, so I'm going to play with some numbers and bury the costs of this treatment somewhere. It's hush-hush, and I can't do it too often.

9120:
Tell them I'm on my way.

9600:
Good. Shouldn't be too long...

10080:
All right! It could be a while, just leave it in my capable hands.

10560:
I wish I was in a position where I could do something better on the cost, but I can't. Hope you'll reconsider.

11040:
Don't take this wrong. Working with you was an adventure, but I sort of got it out of my system. I think the best place for me is right here.

11520:
I'll give ya a decent price on my services, but I will have to include the money you still owe me.

12000:
Before we get into any heavy conversation, I'd feel a lot better if you took care of the gunfire. I'm not crazy about the hospital being in the middle of a combat zone.

12480:
I've actually been giving it some thought. I wouldn't mind getting a firsthand piece of some of those thugs the Queen calls her army. I could be the team doctor, you know, ready to treat, right on the spot.

12960:
No more dragging people here for treatment... I do have some experience with field medicine, and I know a lot of the townsfolk in the countryside. It could help having me around...

13440:
Of course, the risk would be higher. I'd be exposing myself to all kinds of possible dangers. But, I'd be willing to do it for, say, 500 dollars a day...

13920:
Settled, let's get to it.

14400:
Well... it was just a thought.

14880:
I'm pretty sure we've still got the necessary supplies... The hospital has an inventory problem. The few supplies we do manage to get our hands on, some employee keeps stealing.

15360:
Not today, I'm afraid. Someone's been ripping our stuff off. I couldn't find a bandage if your life depended on it.

15840:
Thanks, but no thanks. Using medical supplies from a stranger would have malpractice written all over it.

16320:
You sick son-of-a-bitch.

16800:
Your efforts seem to be paying off. Sometimes I wish I was still part of it. But what's important is you're getting the job done.

17280:
Don't mean to be a stickler about this, but I'll need the cash.

17760:
The entire amount!
