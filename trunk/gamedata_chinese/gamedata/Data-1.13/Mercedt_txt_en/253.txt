Bunch of punks!

1440:
Perp in range.

1920:
I caught a perp off guard.

2400:
Looks like you typical homicide/body dump.

2880:
What was that?

3360:
Let's stay on our toes.

3840:
Let's stay on our toes.

4320:
What was that? A bad joke?

4800:
I could really use some help.

5280:
Something here.

5760:
Something here.

6240:
Need slugs! The sooner, the better!

6720:
I'm a sitting duck... I don't think I can get up. I'm bleeding everywhere.

7200:
The almighty Mike is dead!?

9120:
This is extremely dangerous! I can't get this gun to shoot!

9600:
How big a target do you want?

10080:
Don't worry about me.

10560:
That will keep you awake!

11040:
I can't take the perp down from here.

11520:
I'll need the services of a medic.

12000:
It's almost the end of the shift.

12480:
I gotta drop a couple of pounds.

12960:
How fast do you gotta be to shoot people?

13440:
There's still plenty of leftovers.

15360:
You axed Mike! You got your name in the history books, but in this case it's not really a good thing, is it?

15840:
As far as I'm concerned, there's too many dead down there already.

16320:
I'm having a bad day.

16800:
Now, where did I put those damn Twinkies?

17280:
You just don't know how to play ball!

17760:
Thank you. It brought back fond memories of all the great years I spent in vice.

18240:
Danger may be my business, but since I've been here I'm no longer comfortable with dying as the bottom line. I have to get out!

18720:
You gotta lot of nerve, punk!

19200:
I'm a dedicated mercenary looking for a dedicated employer.

19680:
This is war! You don't get a phone call.

20160:
Are you kidding?

20640:
Maybe it's me, but I can't get it to work.

21120:
You know, I would really prefer to be called Herman, or, uh, sergeant detective Regents... Not that there's anything you can do about it.

21600:
Hey! It's all muscle!

22080:
This calls for a celebration. What do you say we get some eats?

22560:
Have you been bought? Do you have cash problems? Or did you pop a fuse?

23040:
Case closed, the mission has become impossible.

24480:
The opportunity to work with someone of Mike's caliber doesn't happen very often.

25920:
It's a good thing I have my policeman's brotherhood pension to supplement my income. There seems to be an abundance of chizzlers like you out there.

26400:
Ya know... If I killed Mike, nobody would ever call me slow again.

26880:
I'm stunned!

27360:
I really tried to do this.

27840:
Nice talking to you, but I've got better deal elsewhere.

28320:
Perp in vicinity!

28800:
The sooner we get it, the sooner we get to chow down!

29760:
This is where all that muscle comes in handy.

30240:
Looks suspicious to me.

30720:
I pulled my weight. I have no regrets!

31200:
That's the end of that corps!

31680:
If I were still working the beat, I'd take the old phone book to that character and this would be the last scheme he ever pulled.

32160:
This calls for a celebration. What do you say we get some eats?

32640:
Are you kidding?

33120:
I've never made this much money in my life! I'm going back to Chicago to celebrate!

33600:
Come on guys! Stop running!

34080:
It might take me a while, but I can catch up.

34560:
What's for dinner?

35040:
Weren't you paying attention?

35520:
Maybe it's me, but I can't get it to work.

36000:
Whoever put it on, didn't want it to be opened.

36480:
Looks like somebody's been shoveling dirt.

36960:
I can't swim!

37440:
We got it!
