Bad guys.

480:
Time for the enemy to say its prayers!

960:
They got me up against the wall!

1440:
We gotta purple people eater here!

1920:
Geez Louise! It's an honest-to-God...ugly something or other.

2400:
This leads me to think we just missed a nasty scrape with a purple people eater.

2880:
Yo, I heard something.

3360:
Geez, that stinks. Those purple people eaters must be eating too many raw vegetarians.

3840:
Something funny's going on here. I don't like it.

4320:
Wish I'd brought my Saint Ian medal...the patron saint of protection from the purple people eaters.

4800:
Okay, these assholes aren't funny anymore!

5280:
Hmm, what's this?

5760:
Something's lying there.

6240:
Need to reload!

6720:
I've been hit...feels like a sucking chest wound, a concussion and a vasectomy all at the same time.

7200:


7680:


8160:


8640:
Sorry, my mind is somewhere else. What was that again?

9120:
Got a gun jam here.

9600:
They're trying to pound me to a pulp!

10080:
Well...this trip isn't anything like it sounded in the brochure.

10560:
Wonder how many lives I've got left after that.

11040:
Don't think I can make that one.

11520:
Geez, sorry. I'm getting blood all over the place.

12000:
I'm going to drop unless I get some sleep immediately.

12480:
Gimme a minute.

12960:
Nighty-night!

13440:
Cleanup in aisle 2!

13920:


14400:


14880:


15360:


15840:
Geez...talk about losing face...

16320:


16800:
I'm finished here.

17280:
I respectfully refuse, sir.

17760:
Hey-hey, all right! Nothing like seeing a job from beginning to end.

18240:
Alright! Tell me what I've won! Sports car? Gift certificate? Or do I just get to make a really huge omelete.

18720:
I dunno if I've ever met a bigger jackass.

19200:
This whole deal is really starting to get on my nerves.

19680:
Most of these guys'll never make it to MENSA, but they're good enough in a fight.

20160:
We got some unwanted aerial attention!

20640:
This stuff we've got is useless. We'd be better off throwing snowballs.

21120:


21600:


22080:
I'm not your average mercenary.

22560:
Sounds like something an armchair general would come up with, not a seasoned field commander.

23040:
Anyone who didn't see that coming, raise your hand.

23520:


24000:

25920:


26400:
Countryside looks a little too damn quiet for my liking. I say we find this dude and hunker down.

26880:
My eyeballs are waterin'! All I can make out are painful shadows.

27360:
This is futile.

27840:
My kind of guy.

28320:
Enemies have been detected in this area.

28800:
Keep in mind, we didn't get them all.

29280:


29760:
The puff of smoke, the thud of the body... Man, there's nothing like it.

30240:
Isn't that the kid we're supposed to be keeping an eye out for?

30720:
Well, she better say her prayers, cause she's got another thing coming. Like a bullet to the head. Good to be on board with ya.

31200:
Yeah! We're good! Once someone notifies their next of kin, we can move on to the next sector.

31680:
Whoever stole our stuff outta here, I'll be using this box as their coffin, if ya get my drift.

32160:
Stand up and let me do it again! Man, she had that coming... I hate being jerked around like that!

32640:
Puddy-cat! I'm sure I see a puddy-cat!

33120:
You're the best damn commander this side of the tracks. I know it. I was here from day one right until ground zero. Fine job.

33600:
They musta realized the writing was on the wall. They left us the place.

34080:
Resting my eyes for a bit. I'll get on it shortly.

34560:
Back on the clock.

35040:
I second that.

35520:
This dollar-store thing is whacked. It's useless.

36000:
Hold tight! This thing's rigged to blow.

36480:
Keep your feet in the dotted lines, man. Straying could be dangerous.

36960:
Need to... find something that floats... Or I'm... gonna die...

37440:
Got where I needed to be. What's on the agenda?
