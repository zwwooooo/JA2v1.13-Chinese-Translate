Howdy there stranger, the names Charlie Banks.  I'm the proud owner of Charlie's Emporium and Hotdog stand...  Sorry, I'm all outta hot dogs right now.

480:
Well, hello again stranger.

960:
Looks like rain.

1440:
Nice to see you again stranger.

1920:
And just what do you think I'll need that for?

2400:
Just settle down there young fella

2880:
Let's not get excited, we're on the same team you know...

3360:
You really don't want an old geezer like me on your squad.

3840:
You know a tourniquet and some whiskey might be nice about now.

4320:
Well, I'll let you go now, I got a concession stand to run ya know.

4800:
Well, I see you did quite the number on Shark and his pals didn't you?

5280:
If your planning on using the Bullet Train, you'd better be prepared for that kinda Warm Welcome everywhere you go.

5760:
Oh, you're looking for the survivors of the plane crash huh?  Well, I suggest you go over to Calisto, it's probably the friendliest town we got round here.  I'm sure someone over there will know what's going on. 

6240:
I'd be careful if I were you.  Once Shark's Friends find out what you did, you're gonna be in some deep doo doo, if you know what I mean.

6720:
Hey, tell you what I'm gonna do.  Seeing as how you kinda cleared the subway here for some civilized customers, I gonna let you in on a little secret.

7200:
Over there in those lockers, I saw Shark put some stuff.  I got a feeling he won't be needing it anymore.  Might be useful to you.

7680:
If I wasn't so old, I'd kick yer butt!
