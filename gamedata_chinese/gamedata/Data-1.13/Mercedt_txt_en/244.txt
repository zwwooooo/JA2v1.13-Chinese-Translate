Found one! I wanna fry this sucker!

480:
I wanna fry this sucker before I'm spotted.

960:
I'm having it out with some unfriendlies over here!

1440:
Found one!

1920:
I wanna fry this sucker before I'm spotted.

2400:
If you were doing things right, there wouldn't be so many bodies!

2880:
You could avoid the rush.

3360:
Can taste the danger in the air! Let's be extremely careful around here.

3840:
I don't like this! Everything's quiet. Soon I'll feel a short twinge between my shoulders and cold blood will start dripping down my back.

4320:
Call the networks! I found the missing link!

4800:
I'm in contact with a few!

5280:
Found something.

5760:
I'll take care of it.

6240:
Need ammo! I've been caught short!

6720:
Can't... seem to move my legs. Need aid... now.

8640:
I'm slightly disoriented.

9120:
It's jammed. I can't believe this, my gun is jammed!

9600:
I'm caught in shell storm!

10080:
Just take a deep breath...

10560:
Extremely close!

11040:
I question whether even a sharp-shooter could make that.

11520:
I need bandaging.

12000:
I'm pooped!

12480:
Then again - maybe I won't.

12960:
You asked for it!

13440:
You asked for it!

13920:
Goodman's a slob! He's a pig's pig. If you don't get rid of "It", I'm looking for a more civilized outfit.

15360:
You cold-blooded, spineless wimp.

15840:
We apologize for the damage!

16320:
I'm pooped.

16800:
Everything went the way we wanted it to.

17280:
Nonsense!

17760:
I'd say we've earned our pay.

18240:
I can't wait to get out of here.

18720:
I don't see any more point in talking.

19200:
Team spirit has hit an all-time low, and the way you shuffle us around it's no wonder.

19680:
You aren't the type of employer I wanna work for more than once.

20160:
This isn't good!

20640:
This thing have seemed better days.

21120:
They're doing the PBS special on the Watergate break-in! I hear they want to interview me. Heck! They could make me a star!

21600:
You know, not only did I served more time than anyone else involved in Watergate break-in, I served more time than all of them put together.

22080:
I'm hoping to be hearing from a few people.

22560:
Get your act together!

23040:
Like always, everything I've been hoping for - falls through.

23520:
Goodman is a creature. I don't even think he's human. When you get rid of "It", you give me a buzz.

25920:
I've seen enough! Have you ever actually paid anyone?

26400:
He should be put down like a dog.

26880:
This isn't good!

27360:
I ain't making any progress!

27840:
No problem. It wasn't your fault.

28320:
It's simply a question of time!

28800:
Come on out, so we can get this over with!

29760:
Money can't buy you everything.

30240:
I'll take care of it.

30720:
This is crazy! I couldn't possibly have done anything to get fired!

31200:
We're in control here!

31680:
You'd have to be crazy to pay what you did!

32160:
You asked for it!

32640:
Found one!

33120:
It was good. If I fit into your plans again, you look me up!

33600:
That's one less team to contend with.

34080:
I could use some sun, sand and surf.

34560:
Those guys from PBS are supposed to be calling any minute. I don't wanna miss out.

35040:
Didn't you hear me?

35520:
This thing have seemed better days.

36000:
It's got one wire too many.

36480:
Let's pay special attention to where we walk around here.

36960:
I... I can't believe! I'm drowning!

37440:
Everything appears to be in order.
