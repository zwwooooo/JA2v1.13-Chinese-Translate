Sighting!

480:
Have enemy in view!

960:
I may need help!

1440:
Remain calm! Is just bug.

1920:
What the hell is that? Is some kind of joke? Wait. Remain calm. I will be in charge here.

2400:
Leftovers.

2880:
Shh, a noise.

3360:
This smell can't be good for me, or anyone.

3840:
No need to be nervous. I am in charge.

4320:
Could be more bugs in area. I suggest killing them quickly.

4800:
One at time, no rush, you will all die!

5280:
Object.

5760:
I found it.

6240:
No bullets! Need better planning.

6720:
Drop everything! I require medical attention!

7200:
Iggy, you were a valiant servant. Rot in peace.

8160:
Oh, Stephen. Too bad you die. You had potential.

8640:
Focus. Focus. Where was I?

9120:
Jammed! Need better maintenance.

9600:
I have no fear!

10080:
It was nothing.

10560:
Obviously, I did not train them.

11040:
Anyone with half brain would not attempt this shot.

11520:
Blood. Must stop it.

12000:
Need sleep. Now.

12480:
Wait. I catch my breath.

12960:
Defeated. Of course.

13440:
I am good!

14880:
There is no room on this squad for drug abusers like Larry. I refuse to be in the company of such ingrates. They are not trainable.

15360:
I have reached my limit for Roachburn. I will take my leave now! Obviously, you do not realize how important I am.

15840:
It was nothing. I teach people how to do this!

16320:
Water is no place for a soldier, unless in boat.

16800:
Assignment completed.

17280:
Not on your life.

17760:
She is dead. I am happy. She never pay me on time.

18240:
The big creature is dead.

18720:
Not an acceptable human.

19200:
This is the kindergarden of military training.

19680:
If only they would use me as an example. Maybe then, this entire thing could improve.

20160:
Overhead!

20640:
Apparently, someone has forgotten that I am one of the best military men alive and, as such, should get the top equipment available.

21120:
Everybody looks up to me. I sign autographs sometimes.

22080:
I am not surprised. I train toward perfection.

22560:
I see you have had no formal instruction.

23040:
The outcome was on the first page. In very big letters.

24480:
Iggy, you are good.

25440:
Stephan, good job.

25920:
There has been an oversight... I have not been paid.

26400:
I am leaving. I should have known this outfit was not properly trained OR financially secure! Goodbye!

26880:
I can't see! Remain... calm comrade.

27360:
My training is not of use.

27840:
Hm. Properly motivated...

28320:
Enemies are in the area.

28800:
Remember, just because we don't see them does not mean that we can rest. Stay alert! Listen to me.

29760:
In a master's hands, you see what you can do?

30240:
There is the young man. Get him!

30720:
Not a wise decision. Obviously, you were not paying attention to my greatness.

31200:
Well done. All enemies are ready for box.

31680:
This is not acceptable. The thief will die for this.

32160:
She is dead. She deserved it. There is nothing left to see here.

32640:
A bloodcat!

33120:
Obviously, it was my supreme military background which achieved this win. Thank you for... for what, I am not sure, but thank you.

33600:
The enemies have fled. They were unprepared to stay and fight.

34080:
I require sleep before I continue my work.

34560:
I have resumed my assignment.

35040:
Me too, and I am more important.

35520:
What? I must be given functional tools to do job.

36000:
There is trap. It must be disarmed.

36480:
My fine skills have alerted me to danger. I am good.

36960:
I cannot swim... No! Not drowning, oh god!... <glub> Remain..<glub> calm... Swallow less...

37440:
I am in position. What great task shall I undertake now?
