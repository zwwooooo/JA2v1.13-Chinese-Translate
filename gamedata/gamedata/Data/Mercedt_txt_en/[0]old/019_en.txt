Antagonists.

480:
Here comes trouble.

960:
Need assistance here, stat!

1440:
Oh God, it's another THING.

1920:
Oh Christ, it's a bug. I mean, it's arthropoda, so it could be a crustacean, but I have this thing about bugs...I can't look at it. I'm sorry, I can't even look at that thing.

2400:
The arthropoda, they've been here. Sends waves of nausea through me just thinking about it.

2880:
I'm sure I just heard something.

3360:
I smell insect spore. It's so heavy, it has to be coming from those hyperthyridic arthropod things. It's making me dizzy.

3840:
Adrenaline's up. I sense something's about to happen.

4320:
I think those arthropods are nearby. Look at me, my pulse is racing. I'm sweating. I have to get over this extreme fear. It's totally irrational.

4800:
I can't handle this! I have to get out of here, before I lose my mind!

5280:
Bingo...

5760:
I see something...

6240:
I need bullets immediately.

6720:
Losing too much blood here. Shock's gonna set in.

7200:
My friend, Vicki, I would have gladly died in your place if I could, or saved you somehow. God, how the hell am I supposed to stay detached about something like this?

7680:
Kirk, your candle burned so brightly. Nobody was so young at heart, so giving of himself to everybody, so many things to so many people. Rest in peace.

8160:
You and Ron were joined at the hip, Charlene. It's impossible to think of one of you going on without the other. Goodbye, Charlene.

8640:
Whoa, I had a moment of vertigo.

9120:
Misfire. Need to unjam this.

9600:
Can't dodge this forever!

10080:
The pain is immense.

10560:
Was that as close as it felt?

11040:
I'm not that good a shot.

11520:
Ooh, I'm bleeding. Least I'm up on my tetanus.

12000:
I'm too fatigued to go on.

12480:
Gotta slow down before I hyperventilate.

12960:
I'm such a hypocrite.

13440:
That felt good.

14880:
Maybe I'd have more patience with this job if I didn't have to work with holier-than-thou prissies like Sonderguard.

15360:
Mike's dead... by my hand! I don't know whether to be proud of myself or really sickened! Little of both, I guess!

15840:
How can anyone see that and not question what we do for a living?

16320:
I shoulda brought mosquito netting. Bugs transmit so many diseases. Netting should be mandatory.

16800:
What should I tackle next?

17280:
I can't go along with that. Rather, I WON'T go along with that.

17760:
It was either her or us.

18240:
Perhaps now that the thing is dead, I can achieve REM sleep again.

18720:
That idiot's a walking advertisement for planned parenthood.

19200:
Think I'd rather be emptying bedpans than stick around for more of this.

19680:
Just when you think homosapiens can't stoop any lower, you find yourself in a group like this.

20160:
We've got aerial incoming!

20640:
I might as well be working with stone knives and bearskins. Dammit, I'm a professional.

21120:
One of the nice things about this job is all the interesting people you get to meet.

21600:
I don't know why men love this kind of work so much...killing, grunting, scratching, that kind of thing.

22080:
I'm learning all the time.

22560:
I suggest a little more prudent planning is in order.

23040:
Let's try not to make the same mistake next time.

24480:
I'm not surprised. Vicki's the finest.

24960:
It's so great working with Static.

25440:
My favorable impression of Raven was right on the money.

25920:
Give me some more time to assess the operation, then we'll talk.

26400:
Oh, my. It's Mike. I don't know about this.

26880:
Aaaah, that vile substance has caused me to go blind.

27360:
I'm having great difficulty with this. It seems impossible.

27840:
She was real friendly.

28320:
There's an enemy presence.

28800:
I don't believe we've located all of them yet.

29280:
Finally, something worth getting excited about.

30240:
Isn't that the deliquent boy we've been looking for?

30720:
You have our full attention, Miguel. Personally, I feel that anyone who would oppress another deserves to be brought to justice, and that's just what we hope to do to her.

31200:
I'm glad that's over. No more enemies, just casualties.

31680:
What? It doesn't seem to be all here. That's not right.

32160:
I think I saved many lives by ending this one.

32640:
Ah! Tiger!

33120:
It may not have been the easiest job in my life, but in the end, I realized how necessary it was.

33600:
Oh. Thankfully, they've left the area.

34080:
I'm turning in. I'll get back to work soon.

34560:
Count me back in.

35040:
Add me to that list.

35520:
Really! I can't afford to work with equipment that fails.

36000:
Whoa! God only knows what it would do to me.

36480:
Stay alert. Every footstep might be your last.

36960:
Hey... who... will... re... sus... i... tate... me?

37440:
Okay, I've arrived. Ready for anything.

38400:
I'm pretty picky about what assignments I accept. You're a little rough around the edges for me.

38880:
I fail to see how. As a doctor, I try to have reverence for life, as much as this line of work permits. Judging from your past, we don't share this philosophy.

39360:
I'm preparing a presentation on field treatment of hemorrhagic fevers. I might be available after that.

39840:
I'm already committed to covering for a colleague. The earlier you schedule with me, the better the chance I can find the time for you.

40320:
This is Doctor Houston. I'm away from my desk right now, but if you leave a message, someone will get back to you shortly. If this is a medical emergency, call the clinic at JL5-1494 and have me paged.

40800:
Thank you for the chance to work with your team. Let me know if you need me again, and we'll talk.

42240:
Given the nature of our work, I require a certain minimum level of civility. I find that Ms. Sonderguard is decidedly uncivil and really rather snobbish. It's too irritating. I'm sorry.

42720:
It looks like my contract is nearly complete. Shall we discuss renewal, or should I make other plans?

43200:
Very good! I'm looking forward to another stint.

43680:
All right, everything seems to be in order. I'll report for duty.

44160:
Vicki Waters and I get along famously. So, I'm going to say yes to your offer in spite of a few niggling concerns. I'm sure Vicki and I can weather it together.

44640:
Well, it's not the most well-rounded group I've worked with, but Kirk Stevenson is just a hoot. So, I'll say yes.

45120:
I'm not at all sure that this is my kind of project. But frankly, I think Raven is a wonderful person, and I trust her implicitly. So, I'll commit.

45600:
I'm going back to do research for a while. This assignment's just taken too much out of me. I need to regroup.

46080:
Pardon me, I was saying...

46560:
Apparently, my rate is a little higher than you budgeted for.

47040:
Really. Well. Okay, if that's the way you want it. I'm sure I'll be hearing from you again soon.

47520:
I fail to see how. As a doctor, I try to have reverence for life, as much as this line of work permits. Judging from your past, we don't share this philosophy.

49920:

50880:
Pardon me, I was saying...

51360:
Apparently, my rate is a little higher than you budgeted for.

51840:
Dr. Houston. How may I help you?

52320:
I'm not trying to sound morbid, but I really do enjoy field work.

52800:
I've got appointments to get to.

53280:
Okay, we should talk about how long a contract you had in mind.

53760:
I'm too busy for this. Feel free to call back once you've got a better idea of your needs.

55200:
I hope you're keeping in mind that my contract is approaching its end.

55680:
Really, I looked at it from all angles, and I'm worth more now. So, I've changed my rate schedule to reflect that.
