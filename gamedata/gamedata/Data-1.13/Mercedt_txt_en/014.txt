0:
I have an encounter.

480:
Get ready! They're here.

960:
This is not looking very good.

1440:
Not another one!

1920:
Look at the size of it! Oh, my... I hate insects. Even the ones you can squash with your foot.

2400:
Those bugs are hideous.

2880:
Shhhh! Noise.

3360:
What a terrible smell!

3840:
My nerves are wracked. I sense something's about to happen, and it's not good.

4320:
God! I hope there's none of those hideous insects around here.

4800:
Oh my Lord! What a nightmare!

5280:
There's something.

5760:
What's that lying around?

6240:
I'm in need of ammo.

6720:
I don't think I'm going to make it.

7200:
Wolfy... our time together was so... so limited. You were the best. I can't believe you're really gone.

8160:
Ahhh... Grizzly, you were my teddy bear. I wish I had known you for longer.

8640:
Sorry, I'm a little confused.

9120:
Bullet's stuck!

9600:
They've got me pinned.

10080:
I've had back rubs worse than that.

10560:
That was close.

11040:
I'll never connect with that.

11520:
I'm going to have to do something about this bleeding.

12000:
I need my beauty sleep. Soon!

12480:
Need a moment to catch my breath.

12960:
Sweet dreams!

13440:
Even dead, they bother me.

13920:
I wish somebody would take the air out of that macho idiot Steroid.

14400:
I'm all yours, Pops. Just come and get me!

14880:
That Haywire makes me extremely uncomfortable.

15360:
I dated Mike. He had about as much life in him as he does now.

15840:
I don't believe I needed to see that.

16320:
I've always hated insects. Spiders are the worst.

16800:
Ready to move on.

17280:
Not in your lifetime.

17760:
It's about time. She was really getting on my nerves.

18240:
Please! Make that be the end of them.

18720:
What a slimeball.

19200:
This is nothing like I expected it to be.

19680:
I've never been around so many horny people in all my life. Well... at least not since I left All Saints private school.

20160:
Look for cover!

20640:
I'm tired of using the leftovers. I should be getting the best equipment. Especially armor. I've got a body to protect.

21120:
Nothing in my life ever works out.

21600:
Some of these people need to be introduced to soap.

22080:
It pays to pay attention.

22560:
I really don't understand why we'd want to do that.

23040:
That was absolutely brilliant.

23520:
Steroid gives me the creeps. If he has to be in the same country, keep him away from me.

24000:
Pops McGillicutty is a pervert, a sex fiend! Get him out of my face, or I'm quitting.

24480:
Wolfy, you're the best!

25440:
Way to go, Teddy bear.

25920:
That would be a bit premature. Let's wait and see.

26400:
I don't believe it! Mike took a job with the other side?

26880:
What did that thing spit in my eyes? I'm blind!

27360:
Sorry, but I can't manage it.

27840:
There's something about him that kinda intrigues me.

28320:
Get ready! They're here.

28800:
We mustn't forget the ones we didn't get.

29280:
Too much! Now this was worth bending over for.

30240:
That kid looks like he doesn't belong here.

30720:
She won't get very far, Miguel, now that I'm here. Trust me, when it comes to the female mind, I'm a master. Maybe later, you and I could talk more about it.

31200:
Yeah! We did 'em all. I love that.

31680:
Hey! I think something's missing here!

32160:
It's women like her who give all of us a bad name. I, for one, am glad to see her dead, and I bet I'm not the only one.

32640:
I see one, I think "fireplace"...

33120:
Hey hey! What a way to lay 'em out! It makes me feel so good, so warm, so excited all over. I wish there was some way I could thank all of you.

33600:
Whoa... where are they? They pulled out early.

34080:
I need a quick nap. Sweet dreams!

34560:
I'm up and back on top. It does my body a world of good.

35040:
You're not the only one.

35520:
What's a girl have to do to get something that works around here?

36000:
Wait a sec. I don't trust it any more than I do a man's zipper.

36480:
This looks more suspicious than lipstick on a man's collar.

36960:
Wolfy? Grizzly? I'm so wet! I'm going down! Someone... Help me!

37440:
I'm in position and available. As always.

38400:
Sorry, there's been a lot of talk about you... none of it good.

38880:
Sorry, I have a major concern. It's called dying. And too many people who work for you are doing it.

39360:
Sorry, I just got a call from a major Hollywood producer. He says I'm being considered to debut in a feature film, and he wants to see me at his place right away. I could be the next female action hero.

39840:
Perhaps with more notice, but I can't right now. I've made other commitments.

40320:
Hello. This is Cynthia Guzzman. I'm kinda of tied up at the moment. If you'd like me to get back to you, leave a message. If you'd rather I ignored your call, breathe heavy--just once.

40800:
Well... you're running the show. Maybe you'll need me again sometime. Be sure to call.

41280:
Forget it! I wouldn't give it a second thought as long as that pumped-up, pushy Pollack is working for you.

41760:
You still have that old pervert Pops working for you? I haven't changed my mind since I left. As long as he works for you - I don't.

42240:
Sorry, but Haywire is as scary as they get. My future certainly doesn't have us together in the same country.

42720:
I'm a busy girl. You don't want to leave the status of my contract to the final minute.

43200:
Sounds good to me.

43680:
I'll get my things together, and I'll be there as soon as possible.

44160:
Normally I wouldn't jump on your bandwagon, but since Wolfy's on the job, I guess I will be too.

45120:
I've worked with Grizzly for a little while now. I wouldn't say I know Teddy Bear inside out, but I'll put aside my hesitations for the chance to work with him.

45600:
For reasons I don't care to get into, I'd rather go home and shave my legs.

46080:
Like I said...

46560:
Your bank tells me that you're short a deposit. And please, spare me the bad sperm jokes.

47040:
That was a lot shorter than I expected. On the other hand, it might be better that way.

47520:
Sorry, I have a major concern. It's called dying. And too many people who work for you are doing it.

48000:
Forget it! I wouldn't give it a second thought as long as that pumped-up, pushy Pollack is working for you.

48480:
Pops McGillicutty is a pervert, a sex fiend! Get him out of my face, or I'm quitting.

48960:
Sorry, but Haywire is as scary as they get. My future certainly doesn't have us together in the same country.

49440:
Normally I wouldn't jump on your bandwagon, but since Wolfy's on the job, I guess I will be, too.

50400:
I've worked with Grizzly for a little while now. I wouldn't say I know Teddy Bear inside out, but I'll put aside my hesitations for the chance to work with him.

50880:
Like I said...

51360:
Your bank tells me that you're short a deposit. And please, spare me the bad sperm jokes.

51840:
The Fox is listening.

52320:
Don't let my looks deceive you. While I take care of myself, I'm also quite capable of taking care of others, too.

52800:
You're not wearing pants, are you?

53280:
Okay, I imagine you'll want to get maximum value and go long-term?

53760:
This is taking longer than I have. Think about it, then call me back.

54240:
I can't tell you how skeptical I am about being in the same country as Steroid, but I'll give it my best shot. It's a big country right?

54720:
I'm all yours, Pops. Just come and get me!

55200:
We'll be splitting up shortly. My contract's almost up.

55680:
Been getting better at this. A good woman's worth more money, don't you think?
