Woaw.. P! U!... they smell worst than you guys do.

3840:

4800:

5280:

5760:

Ooh!  I don't feel very good.

7200:

8160:
Danny, you made meatball surgery look like... poetry in motion. If I could only be half as good as you were. I really wish it hadn't been you...

8640:
Dah, excuse me, what was I supposed to do?

9120:
Dah, I think the gun really broke this time.

9600:
Somebody call a time out!

10080:
They never mentioned that in the brochure.

10560:
Oooh, I felt that one. Time out!

11040:
Oh come on now, you don't really think I can hit that?

11520:

Mike was the most revered man in all of AIM. I can't believe I killed him. Me!

15840:
Ooh, dat's cool.

16320:
Dah, excuse me, what was I supposed to do?

16800:
I'm all done.

17280:
Day, I ain't gonna do that. Just forget it.

17760:
Dah I got her! I got Her!

18240:

18720:
Dah, you're dumber than I am.

19200:
Boy, I thought things could'nt get any worse and look, I hook you with you.

19680:
I have a little fish, his name is Elmer.

20160:
Planes, coming in!

20640:
I might as well be using manuer because this equipment is worth do do.

21120:
I have a little fish, his name is Elmer.

21600:
Dah, I don't like them anyways.

22080:
I'm learning.

22560:
If you want my opinion, that sucks!

23040:
I knew that would never work.

23520:


24000:


24480:


24960:


25440:
See, I had a good feeling about Danny, and I was right!

25920:
I might be willing, but let's wait a little longer to see how well this works out. Nothing personal, just being cautious.

26400:
Is that Mike? Oh my God, it is!

26880:
I can't see nothin'!

27360:
Dah I can't do this, you need to get somebody else.

27840:
Dah, their not so bad.

28320:
Dah, I got a bad feelin' about this.

28800:
I think we got everybody... errr, maybe not.

29280:
Oh cool, I always wanted one of these.

29760:
I like that...

30240:
Dah, there's that kid your lookin' for.

30720:
We are pleased to come to your aid, Miguel. The situation certainly requires our intensive care.

31200:
That's it, let's go home.

31680:
If I recall correctly, we ordered more than this...

32160:
Oops, I meant to put the safty on.

32640:
Ooooh! Here kitty, kitty, kitty...

33120:
Can I go home now?

33600:
Darn it, they ran away.

34080:
These intern hours are killing me. I'll take a rest and be up for the next shift.

34560:
It was exactly what the doctor ordered. I'm back on the job.

35040:
Yeah, me too.

35520:
I think it's broken this time for good.

36000:
We better be careful, this is booby trapped.

36480:
I would urge extreme caution. That looks suspect to me.

36960:
Somebody help me!

37440:
I made it here first.

37920:


38400:
Oh, I've heard about the way you run things. I don't think I'm up for that kind of grief. At least not this early in my career.

38880:
I'm not your man. I want to get more experience but with your survival rate, I'll never get the chance to put that experience to use.

39360:
I'm really sorry. My research paper's being published in Lancet, and I want to be around for the publicity.

39840:
Oh, I can't. I'm assisting in a combination heart and lung transplant at Mount Sinai, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

40320:
This is Michael Dawson, M.D. I'm probably seeing patients right now, so if you leave a message, I'll call you right back. Thanks.

40800:
This was great. I learned a lot. Thanks for giving me a chance.

41280:


41760:


42240:


42720:
I'll tell ya, my time's just about over. Can I convince you to extend my contract?

43200:
Dah, Okey Dokey...

43680:
Really, you're not just kidden' are you?  Wow! that would be cool... I'm with you.  errr... What did you say your name was again?

44160:


44640:


45120:
Are you kidding? I'd give my right arm to see Danny in action. He's incredible. So yeah, in spite of your... I mean, yeah!

45600:
I'm sorry. After what we've been through, I'm thinking I may not be cut out for this kind of work. I'm going to have to do some soul-searching for a while.

46080:
Don't I know you?

46560:
Apparently, I'm beyond your means.

47040:
Was it something I said? Something I did? Or didn't do? Never mind, you don't owe me any explanations. I'll go.

47520:
I'm not your man. I want to get more experience, but with your survival rate, I'll never get the chance to put that experience to use.

50400:
Dah, Okey Dokey...

50880:
Don't I know you?

51360:
Apparently, I'm beyond your means.

51840:
My name's Marvin Roselli, but everybody calls me Rosebud.

52320:
Don't I know you?

52800:
I'm a good boxer, I like to box.

53280:
I have a little fish, his name is Elmer.

53760:
Ok, I have to go now.
