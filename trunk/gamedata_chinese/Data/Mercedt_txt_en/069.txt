0:
Got a thug!

480:
Always wanted to do this. And here we go.

960:
Prepare the ICU! I'm in deep!

1440:
Got liver here!

1920:
I knew I should have stayed back at the hospital. At least there the livers didn't have legs.

2400:
This suggests that the livers aren't too particular about what they consume. Just as long as it's human.

2880:
Ya hear that?

3360:
Phewf! A body cavity search has a better smell.

3840:
Gotta feeling I shouldn't be here.

4320:
Let's hope the livers had other things to do.

4800:
Closing in on me!

5280:
What's that?

5760:
Have something here.

6240:
Outta bullets.

6720:
Ugh! I'm hemorrhaging... I won't make it...

8640:
Whoa. Had a momentary loss of cognitive function. Where was I?

9120:
Gun's jammed up on me.

9600:
They got me trapped here!

10080:
Now this is gonna bruise...

10560:
Way too close for comfort.

11040:
What I can't see, I can't hit.

11520:
Got an active laceration here.

12000:
Some sleep would do me good.

12480:
Hold on. I gotta increase my cardio.

12960:
One for Arulco!

13440:
Yeah, take that, monster!

15840:
Oh my, I... oh... I think I'm going to be sick.

16320:
I hope we're not going to be in here long. I hate feeling cramped. Puts my... central nervous system on edge.

16800:
Task complete. Next?

17280:
No way. Have your head examined.

17760:
This day, the people of Arulco will celebrate! I had my doubts, but never about this.

18240:
She won't be laying any more livers!

18720:
I've seen afterbirth with more class.

19200:
I should have stayed back at the hospital, but NO, I wanted adventure, excitement. What was I thinking?

19680:
All we need is a sign that says, "Mental Ward."

20160:
Overhead!

20640:
I came along figuring at least I'd get proper equipment. I should have known.

22080:
Practice makes perfect!

22560:
Perhaps there's a... better way to do that.

23040:
Learned something, I hope.

25920:
You know, we had agreed I'd get paid for this.

26400:
Your continued disregard for my salary is not appreciated. I will not be able to partake in this little adventure. It's back to the hospital for me.

26880:
Can't see a thing!

27360:
In my opinion, this is futile.

27840:
Some nice people here, and I've been around long enough to know.

28320:
Got thugs in the area.

28800:
Stay sharp. They're still on the loose here.

29760:
That's why I joined!

30240:
There's the teenager. Let's get him back to the nest.

30720:
It's your choice. I did what I could. I hope it was good enough.

31200:
We just cleared the emergency room, boys and girls, and filled the morgue. Feels good.

31680:
Pablo's been in our stuff. I know it's him. I've treated him for broken knees.

32160:
Sometimes, there's only one treatment. And it's best administered quickly.

32640:
Watch it! I've treated Bloodcat victims!

33120:
I joined for the people. They were only getting sicker. Together, we eradicated the whole damn disease. Great work!

33600:
Clear for now. They may be back, though.

34080:
I'm exhausted. I'll need some shuteye.

34560:
Back on my rounds.

35040:
Add me to the list.

35520:
Oh, how can I work if this doesn't!

36000:
Whoa. Could end up in a body bag.

36480:
Easy does it. That looks very questionable to me.

36960:
Oh no... can't drown... not here... it's... not fair... it's...

37440:
Not sure what I'm supposed to do now that I'm here.
