0:
You will be punished for your intrusion.

480:
I am surprised to see you alive.

960:
Brenda is a good woman. She is just under a tremendous amount of pressure.

1440:
It is too bad you do not know Brenda like I do.

1920:
I cannot take it.

2400:
I have no intention of telling you anything.

2880:
You are speaking with Brenda's most trusted advisor. You will show respect.

3360:
It is not even an option.

3840:
I have been wounded. As Brenda's advisor, you are compelled to offer me aid.

4320:
That is all I have to say to you.

4800:
Yes, i have information about some foreigners, that landed in Atremo today.

5280:
Vince is on his way down here to report about what happened. He'll arrive any moment.

5760:
It's done.

6240:
We have serious problems. I collected some information 'bout those bastards that attacked one of our patrols.

6720:
They are hired guns, some top-notch mercenaries, well trained and probably well equipped. You must know them: That organisation helped your father in Metavira.

7200:
I... I don't know. But maybe it's because of our special guest.

7680:
Hm... wait a minute. There is another thing.

8160:
I really regret to inform you, but you must know this.

8640:
We have lost contact to our governor in Calisto.

9120:
Dont' worry. We will kill them.

9600:
Well, it's about those commandos again...

10080:
Mmh, how can i say... They have taken over Galileo.

10560:
Yes, i'm on my way.

11040:
What has happened?

11520:
Damn it. Sometimes i hate my job. Brenda won't like that news. I am not gonna tell her.

12000:
It's nothing of importance... Only a temporary problem. No need to worry...

12480:
We have lost Troy, but we have already taken action to deal with the new situation.

12960:
What... What was that for?

13440:
I wanted to send some reinforcements to Drake first. Some of our best men are already on their way and will attempt to conquer the town soon.

13920:
Our troops are on their way to Drake. I'm sure, that the situation will be under control again soon...

14400:
You're right. He's useless for us.

14880:
May i take care of him?

15360:
Ahem... I regret to inform you, that I do indeed have a troubling report. Our north west SAM site is now in the hands of the commandos.

15840:
Perfectly clear.

16320:
Ahem, I have an urgent report. The commandos attacked us at our north east SAM.

16800:
No, i'm sorry, um, rather, we were. Apparently, the guards were taken quite by surprise.

17280:
As you command.

17760:
Ahem, I am sorry to hear that. I only wish to keep you informed on the progress of our troops.

18240:
The Central SAM has been overrun by the mercenaries. Our troops did not anticipate...

18720:
Ahem... Not exactly. From theirs.

19200:
Ahem... Yes, it seems the flowers are a gift from the mercenaries. Perhaps they have taken a fondness toward you?

19680:
They are rather pretty.

20160:
Ahem... I am an idiot.

20640:
I'm sorry... but this ain't our helicopter.

21120:
Uhm... Those mercenaries must have managed to get a helicopter under their control and to hire a pilot.

21600:
Ahem, what do you mean?

22080:
Ah... you are talking about that little incident. I just wanted to tell you that...

22560:
You are right. It was under attack and... well, those commandos have captured the town.

23040:
Yes, i'll do my best.

23520:
Brenda, you must leave this place at once! You are not safe here any more!

24000:
Those mercenaries... They have reached the outskirts of Adrian. They could be here any moment.

24480:
Ahem, and what about me?

24960:
Ahem... you know, i did some research on those commandos and the A.I.M.

25440:
I just wonder what happened in Metavira some years ago. What i want to say is: Those A.I.M. guys worked for your father and now they are after you... 

25920:
Yes! It is just as you requested, and, while I regret that your troops were not able to capture all of them, this is certainly a start.

26400:
Yes, of course!

26880:
As you command. Should I release them, then? It has been a most cooperative and informative interrogation.

27360:
As you command. Should I summon the doctor to treat the injuries here?

27840:
he-heh, heh, heh, heh. You idiot!

30720:
Very good.

31200:
You cannot buy me.

31680:
Brenda will make you pay!
