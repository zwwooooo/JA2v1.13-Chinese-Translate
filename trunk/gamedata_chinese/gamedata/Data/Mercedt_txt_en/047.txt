Think I see something... ahhhhh... probably not.

6240:
Need lead for my toy, man.

6720:
You think I could have one last good shot of something? Don't sound like too much to ask.

7200:
Ah not Static, man. Well... RIP, man. Not sure what it means, but I see it on graves all the time.

8160:
Steroid, oh man... you're not to be seen no more. You were one pumped up Polish prince, man. I'll give you a little something to take with you.

8640:
I can't remember...remember anything, man.

Get real, man. The chick's an accountant! Flo's got no business being here. Just 'cause the boss popped a zit over her, don't mean I gotta die!

15360:
I quit, man! Another day in Arulco with Florence of France, and I'd shoot her myself, man... I mean... you gotta know it's gonna happen.

This place sucks, man! I liked it better in rehab... and they gave us crayons.

What third world country was this crap made in, man?

Feel like I'm losin' my edge.

Man... that's exactly what I was thinking.

23040:
Maybe we should take another whack at it, man?

23520:
I gotta get outta here, man. Biff craps his pants so often, he should be wearing a diaper. Maybe AIM will take me back. Just need some Visine and a shower, man.

24480:
Static's the best, man. He's got style.

25440:
Steroid puts out a fire like nobody else, man.

They're all dead, man. Or really, really sick...

31680:
Ah, man, I think the Customs guys got into this box.

32160:
I knew people like her in rehab, except they couldn't be fixed quite as quickly, man.

32640:
What a trip, man!

33120:
Said I couldn't do it, man! But I did. Heh, I feel good. Sorta like I could do anything... maybe even get sober.  Nah, who am I foolin'? Take it a day at a time, man.

33600:
The grunts put it in reverse, man. Didn't leave no forwarding address.
