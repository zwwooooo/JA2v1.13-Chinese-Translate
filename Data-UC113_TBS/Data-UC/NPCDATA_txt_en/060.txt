Oooooh... That feels good.

Yeah, that?s it, right there.

Uh-huh, didn?t think so.

Is that the best you can do?

What, you think you can handle this?

Awww... That?s so cute, but I am going to pass.

Ow that hurts, and I usually like pain.... Aaaarrrggghhhh!

Gotta run! There's a martini calling my name.

Sorry honey, can't talk and use my hands at the same time.

Ok, I need a drink. Who's buying?

How could I turn down an offer like that? Count me in! Need help with what's going on in Danubia? I'm your guided tour commentator as well.

6240:
Got eyes like a cat, handy with first aid, and additionally, I know how to handle weapons, so with all modesty.... you made a wise choice!

You guys are professionals, right? I mean, I don't want to get my arse shot off prancing around this country in a state of mayhem with a bunch of amateurs leading the way.
