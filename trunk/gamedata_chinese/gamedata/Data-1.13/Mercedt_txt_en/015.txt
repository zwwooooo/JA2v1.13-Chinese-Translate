0:
Inferiors!

480:
Finally, the company has arrived.

960:
I've been in better predicaments.

1440:
Another grotesque visitor.

1920:
By jove! Looks like a bloody ant, or, or worm, with kangaroo legs.

2400:
Those buggers have quite the appetite.

2880:
I heard something rather distinct, yet I am unsure as to what it was.

3360:
What an offensive odor!

3840:
It would be unwise to let down our guard around here.

4320:
Perhaps we could use Biff Apscott as bait to draw out those bloody big ants.

4800:
Blasted ants are making a picnic of me!

5280:
An article of interest here.

5760:
Something has caught my eye.

6240:
My firearm is in need of reloading.

6720:
I doubt I shall see another day... send the Queen my regards.

7200:
I prefer not to have to fight this one without you, Scope. You made our country proud.

8160:
Stephan Rothman is dead? I fail to grasp the reality of it. He was so young, so professional... so neutral.

8640:
Sorry, but I am a tad disoriented.

9120:
Oh, bloody hell! My firearm is jammed.

9600:
Rather determined blokes aren't they.

10080:
Most unpleasant! I'll be retiring on a hard surface tonight.

10560:
That was rather unsettling.

11040:
The result could be a disappointment, I am afraid.

11520:
I have a knick that requires medical attention.

12000:
My apologies, but I feel the need to retire for a shift.

12480:
I need time to recuperate.

12960:
Pity...

13440:
Good.

13920:
I can think of none more deserving. Skitz should've been made a ward of the state years ago.

14880:
I am searching for the proper way to phrase this. Haywire is FREAKING BLOODY BONKERS! Keep him away from me, please. Though I doubt this country is large enough.

15360:
So long old chum. You should never have gone against the grain.

15840:
I could rattle off a couple of bad hat jokes. However, that would be most distasteful.

16800:
Assignment completed.

17280:
Terribly sorry, but I cannot fulfill your request.

17760:
The gall... referring to herself as Queen. Cadaver seems so much more appropriate.

18240:
Jolly good! Let's hope she was the sole source of those gigantic ants.

18720:
Quite the wastrel.

19200:
This operation is beginning to leave a rather vulgar taste in my mouth.

19680:
I, for one, have always believed that there should be certain standards with regards to the personnel permitted to enter this line of work.

20160:
Seek shelter!

20640:
The equipment I have been getting appears to be bought from some manufacturer on a Saturday morning, or that shifty Irishman, O'Brien.

21120:
Tomorrow will be a better day.

21600:
The Aussies... not an ounce of class amongst them.

22080:
Refining my skills.

22560:
I assume you've weighed the consequences.

23040:
I must say, the writing was on the wall.

23520:
Apparently Skitz is on the loose! If I'm not mistaken, that's him over there.

24480:
I'd marry that girl, if she wasn't already married, of course.

25440:
That young Swiss chap is a true professional.

25920:
Sorry, but I can't commit to anything right now.

26400:
Either Mike has lost his mind, or they're paying him a bloody fortune.

26880:
Oh, lovely! Splashed into my eyes and blinded me.

27360:
Sorry but I am unable to accomplish that.

27840:
A likable enough chap.

28320:
Enemies detected in this area.

28800:
Prudence is the operative word. We have not disposed of all our foes.

29760:
I do believe I owe my firearm a thorough cleaning.

30240:
I believe we've located the imp on the run.

30720:
Fret not, Miguel. We will thwart her at every turn.

31200:
Jolly good! That's the last of them.

31680:
Can't say I didn't see this coming. There's stuff missing from this blasted lot.

32160:
That was no lady. I'm afraid she didn't leave us much choice. Pity.

32640:
Blasted tiger!

33120:
Bloody well right, I say! We showed them how things get done in the civil manner of the first world. Perhaps, they'll erect a statue in our honor.

33600:
The rascals have scattered. I believe they've recognized their inferiority.

34080:
I shall retire and resume work shortly.

34560:
Good, then, I'm back to work.

35040:
My sentiments exactly!

35520:
Blasted second-rate equipment!

36000:
Bloody hell... have a live one here.

36480:
Tread carefully. It could get a slight bit nasty around here.

36960:
Help me... tiring rather... help!

37440:
Right-o. I'm here and awaiting assignment.

38400:
Sorry. If I were in your shoes, I'd change my name when recruiting. Word does get around, old chap.

38880:
No. Sorry... Arulco is already rather littered with your casualties.

39360:
I am terribly sorry, but I'm on my way out to a cricket match. The chaps would be a tad testy if I missed yet another one.

39840:
It is a shame really. I was sort of hoping that you would ask, but when you didn't, I accepted another assignment.

40320:
Sorry, Sidney Nettleson is currently unavailable. However, if you'd be kind enough to leave your particulars, I shall attempt to make contact with you shortly.

40800:
I must say, I was looking forward to seeing this conflict through to its conclusion. However, I could very well be back. Tally-ho!

41280:
Sorr, but Skitz is on your team.

42240:
During my years in A.I.M., I have worked with some highly unsavory characters. Reuban springs to mind. Yet I never refused to join a team due to one of its members. However, Haywire I am afraid, has changed all that.

42720:
Sorry for the intrusion. I am currently soliciting offers for future employment and thought you might be interested in proposing a contract extension?

43200:
Jolly good! I enjoy getting those minor technicalities out of the way so I can concentrate on the matters at hand.

43680:
We are in agreement. I shall be there without any unnecessary delay.

44160:
Regardless of any personal concerns, I would never pass up the opportunity to work with Scope. Consider me signed on.

45120:
Working alongside Stephan Rothman has been an unexpected pleasure, one I would gladly repeat despite the leeriness I have for your operation.

45600:
Sorry, but this assignment was, perhaps, the worst in recent memory. I have no doubt something better will come along.

46080:
Sorry, I said...

46560:
Unfortunately your bank returned with rather distressing news. Looks like I won't be working for you after all, old chap.

47040:
It was a rather long flight, oh well... now that you know what I'm capable of, perhaps my next stint will be a tad more satisfying.

47520:
No. Sorry... Arulco is already rather littered with your casualties.

48000:
It's your choice, dear boy. But if Skitz Bonner stays on your team, I won't.

48960:
During my years in A.I.M., I have worked with some highly unsavory characters. Reuban springs to mind. Yet I never refused to join a team due to one of its members. However, Haywire I am afraid, has changed all that.

49440:
Regardless of any personal concerns, I would never pass up the opportunity to work with Scope. Consider me signed on.

50400:
Working alongside Stephan Rothman has been an unexpected pleasure, one I would gladly repeat despite the leeriness I have for your operation.

50880:
Sorry, I said...

51360:
Unfortunately your bank returned with rather distressing news. Looks like I won't be working for you after all, old chap.

51840:
Sidney Nettleson at your service.

52320:
If you won't be in need of your telephone for the next couple of hours, I'd be more than willing to fax you my references.

52800:
This is taking a tad bit longer than I expected.

53280:
And precisely how long will you be in need of my services?

53760:
You don't appear to be prepared to make a commitment at this moment. Perhaps I'll be here when you're ready. Tally-ho!

55200:
Sorry for the bother, but I thought I should mention that my contract shall be completed in full shortly.

55680:
Oh yes, pardon me, there's been a relatively minor rate adjustment.
