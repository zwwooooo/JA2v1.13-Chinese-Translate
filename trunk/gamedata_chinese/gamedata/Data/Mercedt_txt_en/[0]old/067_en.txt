0:
Looking at trouble.

480:
I knew it couldn't stay quiet forever.

960:
Oh, boy...

1440:
Bug beast.

1920:
That's one heck of a scary looking thing.

2400:
Those bugs are going to devour this whole country.

2880:
What did I hear?

3360:
<sniff> Place smells like a neglected barn.

3840:
I wish they'd just show themselves. I hate this feeling.

4320:
It's sort of spooky around here.

4800:
These bugs are driving me crazy.

5280:
Might need that.

5760:
Here's stuff.

6240:
I need to find ammo fast.

6720:
With a little bit of luck... I might just pull through this. But god, it hurts.

7200:
Dynamo's dead? That man was like a father to me. Saved my butt in Tixa. Literally.

8160:
They got Ivan? That guy was unbelievable. Trust me, they can get anyone of us.

8640:
I'm a little confused.

9120:
I think there's a bullet stuck in my gun.

9600:
I need cover fire!

10080:
I didn't deserve that.

10560:
That was all too real.

11040:
I'm no expert, but can I really be expected to make that shot?

11520:
I could use some first aid.

12000:
I'm beat. I need to catch some winks.

12480:
Pace is brutal, can't catch my breath.

12960:
Discharged.

13440:
Feels good.

15840:
I don't think I ever want to see that again. Actually, I know I don't!

16320:
Water gives me nightmares. I saw a couple of my cousins go under when I was young. I haven't been comfortable since.

16800:
I'm done.

17280:
Can't you find someone else?

17760:
Too much! My name shall be etched in the history of this country forever. Breeham Druz, savior of Arulco.

18240:
I killed the beast. Be kinda sharp to have one of those antennas, wouldn't it?

18720:
Dipshit!

19200:
I'm not a professional, I know that. But this isn't half as exciting as I thought it would be.

19680:
Okay... so Arulco has its share of idiots. Just like any other country.

20160:
Airborne!

20640:
I know I'm not a great mercenary, but do I always have to get the leftovers?

21120:
The worst is behind us. It's smooth sailing from here on in.

22080:
I'll be a pro in no time.

22560:
There has to be a better way.

23040:
Pretty much the only result possible.

24480:
Dynamo hums!

25440:
Is this Ivan unbelievable or what?

25920:
I'm wondering when I am going to see the money you promised me.

26400:
You're laughing at me. I'm never going to see any money, am I? I'm going to work with the rebels.

26880:
Ahhh! The bug beast blinded me...

27360:
I'll be an old man before I ever get that.

27840:
It's nice to get some cooperation for a change.

28320:
I'm detecting an army presence.

28800:
The army is still close by.

29280:
Wow! I can't believe my luck.

30240:
It's Joey Graham. Let's not go too hard on the kid. I know where he's coming from.

30720:
I can't believe you aren't keeping me. Twenty measly bucks. You can't find twenty measly bucks?

31200:
Right on! Army lost another battle. None of them left alive.

31680:
I don't think it's all here. This is just like in prison, except there, I knew who took it.

32160:
She woulda made a good warden. And a good warden is a dead warden.

32640:
AHHHH! Bloody Bloodcat.

33120:
Hey! I did it, er, we did it! That make me a hero in your book? You know, I can't wait to see the look on my parents' faces when I tell them, ah, not that I really care.

33600:
The army musta retreated. There's no one here anymore.

34080:
I'm going to crash for a bit. I'll work again when I get up.

34560:
Okay, I'm on the job.

35040:
Read my mind. I was just thinking that.

35520:
This thing just isn't working right at all.

36000:
Hey! This could kill me!

36480:
Careful. I have a bad feeling about this area.

36960:
The... current.. gotta get out! Hey!.. someone... anyone... I can't... swim.

37440:
Okay, I'm here. Now what?
