0:
Enemy agent.

480:
Let's show them what we are made of!

960:
I'm up to my neck in hot water!

1440:
Look, another cuddly creature!

1920:
Aww, isn't he cuddly? I wonder if they can be domesticated. Probably not.

2400:
Ach, the delightful little monsters were frolicking here.

2880:
I'm hearing weird noises, ja.

3360:
I think those adorable little creatures were doing their business here. The aroma is very rich.

3840:
Things are too quiet here. I believe nothing is as it seems.

4320:
We should take pains to avoid the cuddly creatures until we have the proper equipment: a leash and muzzle. And maybe something for them to chew on.

4800:
I love their natural aggression, but I am having trouble getting them under control!

5280:
Should take a closer look.

5760:
Finders keepers.

6240:
My gun is without bullets.

6720:
Get medical attention or put me out of my misery, but don't leave me here to suffer with these wounds!

7200:
But... Ivan was my mentor! He taught me the ins and outs of the mercenary life. He taught me how to kill with grace and endurance.

8160:
Buns, watching you kill was like watching a beautiful dance of death. Had you lived, I would have made you the happiest mercenary on earth.

8640:
I was enjoying my thoughts and...now I am without any.

9120:
This traitorous gun didn't fire as requested.

9600:
They're going ballistic on me!

10080:
Ho hum. I give that a three on the skirmish scale.

10560:
Nothing is as reaffirming as a close one.

11040:
Who do I look like, Siegfried and Roy?

11520:
No cause for alarm! However, parts of me are bleeding.

12000:
I must sleep. And I will not take nein for an answer.

12480:
At this pace, I will lose consciousness.

12960:
That... is a dead enemy.

13440:
My small part to control the pet population.

15360:
Since Mike was the top merc, and I killed Mike, does this not make me the new top Merc? I believe so!

15840:
What a spectacular way to die.

16800:
My task is done.

17280:
Nein. I cannot accept that order.

17760:
My mother would be so proud of me!

18240:
I have never doomed a race to extinction before! Lynx told me it was a special thrill.

18720:
That lummox is not even fit to polish my brass.

19200:
I have endured assassins, wild animals, and an entire Barry Manilow album, but I am losing patience with this C.O. of ours!

19680:
These are not the most disreputable, unsavory people I have ever worked with. I did do three semesters of law school.

20160:
Red alert! Aerial bombardment!

20640:
Tell me this equipment is meant merely as a test of my ability to operate under adverse conditions.

21120:
The worst is behind us.

21600:
I am glad I am not a female mercenary. They are not treated very well.

22080:
There's always room to grow.

22560:
There must be another approach.

23040:
Perhaps you can learn something from this.

24480:
Ivan is the master. It is an honor to work with him.

25440:
Buns is an excellent warrior...and a stunning woman!

25920:
Right now, I'm uncertain as to the appeal of our arrangement.

26400:
I see Mike... working on the other side? This puts a not-so-amusing light on the situation.

26880:
Shoot! I have been blinded.

27360:
I really should find something else to do.

27840:
Imagine calling this country home.

28320:
There are enemies in the vicinity.

28800:
We failed to locate all of them. I would not go crazy.

29280:
I am elated. It should be gift wrapped.

30240:
I have spotted the kid. If Joey's mother so desires, I'll happily wallop his buttocks.

30720:
It is our duty to rid this country of her presence. You will find us eager and ready to help you.

31200:
Ja! The enemies are dead.

31680:
I am suspicious of this shipment. I believe we have been cheated.

32160:
I won't be losing any sleep over it.

32640:
Good pussy, ja...

33120:
I am most proud to call myself a teammate. The leadership, excitement and adventure were all that I could ask for. I will be sad for this parting.

33600:
Ja, the enemies have left the sector. The wimps.

34080:
I will sleep now and work even harder when I wake.

34560:
Exactly what I needed. Back to the task at hand!

35040:
Ja, me too.

35520:
Broken! My patience is being tested.

36000:
Halt! Got a trap here.

36480:
Hmm. The ground looks unnatural.

36960:
Help! Drown... ing... ja....

37440:
Ja, I am here now.

38400:
Not you! I don't like listening to gossip, but there appears to be a consensus that you are not really much of a commander.

38880:
Not with you! You go through good soldiers as if they were a dime a dozen. I consider your proposition an unacceptable risk.

39360:
I cannot. I'm getting my pilot's license. You may congratulate me.

39840:
I cannot, I need to be in divorce court. Had you given me more notice I could have got a continuance or made whatever arrangements were necessary.

40320:
Ja, das ist Grunty, Helmut Grunther. I will return your call, but you must leave a message. Now.

40800:
Very well. It has been a delight to work for you.

42720:
It is fast approaching the end of our contract. I assume you wish to renew, ja?

43200:
You have chosen wisely.

43680:
Super.

44160:
I would gladly eat nails to work wherever Ivan is working. So, I am delighted to join. Please do not tell Nails what I just said or interpret any untoward.

45120:
I have a certain attraction to Buns Sonderguard. I think it is the endearing way she cocks her head to the side just before she blows a hole in an enemy's gut. Since she's with you, I am with you, too.

45600:
Nein, nothing to take personally, but I find your style irritating and amateurish. I don't think I'll ever work for you again.

46080:
Achtung! I told you...

46560:
You should have brought cash. Because I don't come cheap, and I don't take American Express.

47040:
You reveal your bad judgment. Very well, goodbye.

47520:
Not with you! You go through good soldiers as if they were a dime a dozen. I consider your proposition an unacceptable risk.

49440:
I would gladly eat nails to work wherever Ivan is working. So, I am delighted to join. And please do not tell Nails what I just said or interpret any untoward.

50400:
I have a certain attraction to Buns Sonderguard. I think it is the endearing way she cocks her head to the side just before she blows a hole in an enemy's gut. Since she's with you, I am with you, too.

50880:
Achtung! I told you...

51360:
You should have brought cash. Because I don't come cheap, and I don't take American Express.

51840:
Ja, das ist Grunty.

52320:
I'm sure you're aware of my record with A.I.M. If not, you should review it immediately.

52800:
Make it shnappy!

53280:
How long do you wish to engage my services?

53760:
Life is too short to sit around. Goodbye.

55200:
Ja, ist almost time for us to part company. My engagement is nearly over.

55680:
I am now worth a bit more with my experience, ja?
