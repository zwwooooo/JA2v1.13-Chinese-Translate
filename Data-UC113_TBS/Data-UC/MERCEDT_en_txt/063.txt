Another customer! 

480:
Your butt is mine!

960:
There's a line-up. 

1440:
It looks like it could be trouble. 

1920:
I started at the post office after I left high school! Put in twenty-two years of dedicated service, and then... this!

2400:
I hate one of those types.

2880:
You gotta appreciate this... 

3360:
I don't get paid enough for this. 

3840:
I'm bored.

4320:
I've called for a boycott! 

4800:
There's a mad rush for my services.

5280:
More stuff. 

5760:
Seen it... 

6240:
No Ammo! I need a resupply! 

6720:
I'm going need serious medical attention if I'm going to live to collect my disability. 

7200:
I'm gonna get the son-of-a-bitch who killed Reuban and send tiny parts of his body to every state in the continental U.S. of A. Postage due! 

7680:


8160:


8640:
They insist on changing the route on me... 

9120:
Gun's screwed! 

9600:
He doesn't know who he's shooting at! 

10080:
Like I care... 

10560:
Once I'm through with you, they'll be able to bury you in a standard, number eight, Manila envelope! 

11040:
Everyone always wants the impossible. 

11520:
It doesn't look like the bleeding is going to stop. 

12000:
Either I take a short break now, or I'm lying down for a long one. 

12480:
Short break now!

12960:
Next! 

13440:
It's done... 

13920:


14400:


14880:


15360:
I quit! You have no respect for labor!

15840:
Whippity-do! 

16320:
I won't be able to make it.

16800:
It's done... Hope you're happy. 

17280:
I'm already doing something! 

17760:
To hell with you!

18240:
We won't be seeing anybody wearing that color any more. 

18720:
You'd better pray we never cross paths!

19200:
I'm bored! I joined for the carnage. Things are far too quiet for me to hang around! 

19680:
I have to burn all that employees of A.I.M.

20160:


20640:
It was broken when I got it. 

21120:
I'm union! Better be careful how you treat your people. 

21600:


22080:
I don't get paid enough for this. 

22560:
This mission is in the toilet! 

23040:
Like I care... 

23520:


24000:


24480:
Reuban's probably the only person on the planet who I wouldn't enjoy killing. He's cheap labor. Our country was built by guys like him. 

24960:


25440:


25920:
Well... Let's just say I'm not available. 

26400:
I'm union! I don't work for anything below scale. I Quit!

26880:
I pulled out my back... 

27360:
There's a harebrained idea. 

27840:
Our country was built by guys like him. 

28320:
I could take you and that ragamuffin band of paper-pushing, numb-butted, overpaid, insignificants all by myself! 

28800:
I was promised carnage! Plenty of carnage!

29280:
That's impressive!

29760:
Oh... What a life. 

30240:
It's that good-for-nothing! Now we got to get it all the way back. 

30720:
Sure thing! It's why I joined... Cash, carnage, and no more polyester uniforms! 

31200:
I've seen more gunfire at the postal station. 

31680:
No stuff! Someone's gonna have to answer for this! 

32160:
I don't appreciate affordable labor being abused like that! 

32640:
Where's my pepper spray? 

33120:
Oh... What a life. 

33600:
Personally, I think we should get a bonus when things go this well. 

34080:
I'm having my coffee. I'll get back to you...when I'm finished. 

34560:
Keep your eyes on the clock. I don't do overtime. 

35040:
I'm joining!

35520:
It was broken when I got it. 

36000:
You can't trust the government. 

36480:
I can't go there...

36960:
I'm going under... It's a bitch there's nobody to take with me... 

37440:
I'm bored! I joined for the carnage!
