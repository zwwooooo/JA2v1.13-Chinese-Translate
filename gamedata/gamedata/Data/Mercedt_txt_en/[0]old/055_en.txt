0:
Enemy in view.

480:
We've got trouble.

960:
I'm overloaded here!

1440:
We got one of those whatchamacallits.

1920:
Holy Mother of...what the hell do you call that?

2400:
Those giant thingamabobs must've come this way.

2880:
I don't know what I just heard, but I don't like it.

3360:
Ecch...smells rotten, like one of those big whatever-they-ares.

3840:
I don't like how quiet it is.

4320:
Sure hope we don't bump into a big whozeewhatsis.

4800:
These things aren't playing fair!

5280:
What's that?

5760:
There seems to be something over there.

6240:
An empty weapon is never good.

6720:
Hope I don't look as bad as I feel.

8640:
I got distracted. Give it to me again.

9120:
This gun's jammed.

9600:
I'm in the hotseat here!

10080:
Was that supposed to hurt?

10560:
Suddenly I feel really glad to be alive.

11040:
I'm not very confident about that shot.

11520:
Permission to stop bleeding, somebody?

12000:
I'm about to fall asleep on my feet.

12480:
Need to breathe.

12960:
Another down.

13440:
Killed one.

15840:
I hate to look at that kind of thing.

16800:
I'm finished my task.

17280:
I can't comply with that order.

17760:
All right, go home, there's nothing to see here.

18240:
I've got to believe that thing was here for a reason...but damned if I know what that could've been.

18720:
Hate to say it, but what a loser.

19200:
I don't feel like I'm doing any good here. And being here isn't doing me much good either.

19680:
I get the feeling that everybody on this team is only out for themselves.

20160:
Enemy planes approaching.

20640:
Everything I've got either needs repair or replacement. This is no way to wage a battle.

22080:
Improvement. Feels good.

22560:
I believe we need a better approach.

23040:
I'm hardly surprised that didn't go as intended.

26400:
That chopper pilot's a madman. He made me nauseous. Oh, well... It's off to find Miguel.

26880:
Ow, got me in the eyes. Ah, they're on fire!

27360:
Surely, there's something else I could be doing.

27840:
Wish I met her under other circumstances.

28320:
There are enemies in proximity.

28800:
There's at least one of them isn't accounted for. Could be waiting for the right moment to surprise us.

29280:
Here's something to perk up my day.

30240:
Isn't that Joey Graham over there?

30720:
Not with us here, she won't. Count on it.

31200:
One for our side! All enemies are down.

31680:
It appears there's been a theft here. Stuff's missing.

32160:
Forgive me for being cold and calculating, but that woman was a complete zero in any book. They'll probably throw us a parade.

32640:
Cougar!

33120:
My first mission ever, and I'm proud to say that you got me through it. Well done, from beginning to end.

33600:
They musta slipped out. No enemy presence in the sector.

34080:
I'll grab a few z's and get back on the job.

34560:
Rested and returning to work.

35040:
I was just going to say that.

35520:
Maintenance could have prevented this. Now, it's nothing but dead weight.

36000:
This's got "deadly" written all over it.

36480:
Watch out. I'd keep my toes off of that.

36960:
Need a... line here! I'm... drowning! Anyone...

37440:
Safe arrival. I'm prepared for the next assignment.
