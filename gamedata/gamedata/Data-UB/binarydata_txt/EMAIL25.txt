Help!!!

640:
I am sorry, but once again I must beg for your services. Arulco has come under a new threat. Yesterday, Tixa was destroyed by a missile attack. It was most fortunate that the prison is not being used, and only a few people were injured. ¡À

1280:
Hours later, I received a call from the Ricci Mining and Exploration Corporation. They are the company that depleted Arulco's mines for the benefit of Deidranna. They are a company famous for depleting the resources of most of the countries in this part of the world. ¡À

1920:
They are also known for corruption, manipulating local politics, and hiring mercenaries to protect their operations. This time, it seems, they have set up a base in Tracona, the country directly north of Arulco. It would be easy for them to do. Tracona is run by its military. ¡À

2560:
I have a contact in the country who has confirmed that a missile facility was built. Ricci Mining wants immediate access to Arulco's mines or they will begin to destroy other towns. They promise it will rain missiles unless they are allowed back into my country. ¡À

3200:
I have no army, and my people are tired and weary of war. I do not want a conflict with Tracona, but the missiles facility must be destroyed. This threat against my country must be removed, and I can think of no better person for the job than you. ¡À

3840:
I have made arrangements to transport a team of up to six mercenaries into the country by helicopter. An amount, which I believe should cover your fees, has been deposited in the same bank account as usual. I will stay in contact. ¡À

4480:
Best of luck, my friend. ¡À ¡À Enrico Chivaldori ¡À

5120:
Inquiry

5760:
I have not heard from the pilot, Capt. Jerry Melo. I hope everything is all right. I expected him to be back by now, but still no word. Please advise. ¡À ¡À Enrico Chivaldori

6400:
Still No Word

7040:
I have not heard from you since you left Arulco and the pilot has not yet returned. Please advise. Have you landed in Tracona? The fate of my country is in your hands. I must know of your progress. There are some who believe you have fled with our money. ¡À

7680:
I have assured them that this is not the case, yet I am still very troubled by this lack of news. ¡À ¡À I hope everything is all right.  ¡À Enrico Chivaldori

8320:
I have heard the Good News.

8960:
Word has come from Omerta that you are in Tracona and have met Manuel. He is a good man. He has devoted his life, even abandoning his family, for the people of Arulco. Yet, I am still concerned. Why you have not contacted me since your arrival. Are you facing more resistance than anticipated? ¡À

9600:
I have also learned that Manuel is aiding you with your mission. I do not know how much help he will be, however his loyalty is without question and his determination has made him a hero to our country. He is a man you can place your faith in. ¡À

10240:
I will end this letter by saying that I am happy that you are indeed in Tracona, and once again on your way to liberating my people from those that wish us harm.  ¡À ¡À Good Luck. ¡À Enrico Chivaldori

10880:
Hello Old Friend.

11520:
I sorry I be late in sending message to you. Enrico tell me there be problem making contact with you. I want to wish you luck. I most grateful that you be helping us. You be one with skill to make dream of my country real. ¡À

12160:
I sleep good knowing you take care of business. ¡À Thank you again and again, ¡À ¡À Miguel Cordona ¡À

12800:
Concerned.

13440:
It is true that I do not know when an attack will be launched on my country, yet I worry with each hour that passes that we are getting closer to total destruction. I beg you to end this threat quickly. ¡À ¡À Enrico Chivaldori ¡À

14080:
Urgent

14720:
The Ricci Company is becoming more threatening. They know you are in the country, and blame Arulco for your visit. You must move quicker. I fear they will launch the missiles soon to teach us, and other neighboring countries, a terrible lesson. ¡À

15360:
I know it is not easy, but you must find a way to bring this matter to an end. ¡À ¡À I beg of you, ¡À Enrico Chivaldori

16000:
I Sorry.

16640:
It be with sadness that I not show myself to be leader. I not well. Enrico has taken over my duties. I will know more of my condition in days to come. I want you to know I wish I be with you fighting for what is very important. ¡À

17280:
When I better, I go to Tracona and help you with struggle. I would like this very much. ¡À ¡À Thank you, again and again, ¡À Miguel Cordona

17920:
I Sorry.

18560:
It be with sadness that I not show myself to be leader. I not well. Enrico has taken over my duties. I will know more of my condition in days to come. I want you to know I wish I be with you fighting for what is very important. ¡À

19200:
I be told good friend Manuel be part of team. He be special man. No man has taken chance for Arulco like Manuel. He know danger for his life before he go to army. It must be very hard to live with enemy every day of life knowing if they find truth, they kill you. ¡À

19840:
I will know what be wrong with me soon. When I better, I go to Tracona and help you with struggle. I would like this very much. ¡À ¡À Thank you, again and again, ¡À Miguel Cordona

20480:
News be no good.

21120:
I have talk with doctor. The news be no good. They tell me I have short time to live. I will not get better. I am try very hard to understand what they say to me, but it no be easy. It be strange that a man like me face bullets and bombs, but get sick from cigarettes. ¡À

21760:
There be nothing to be done. God and time will change this. I ask you make Arulco safe soon, so I be sure my country be free from danger. ¡À ¡À Miguel Cordona

22400:
Now I Understand

23040:
I received your mail. I am sorry for the problems the pilot caused you. I realize no communication to the outside must have made things difficult. He was the only pilot I could find quickly. He was not from Arulco. He was not cheap, either. And, he still has not been seen by anyone. ¡À

23680:
I trust this letter finds you safe and in control of your fate. ¡À ¡À Yours truly, ¡À Enrico Chivaldori

24320:

25600:
I wish to compensate you for the extra difficulties you have faced because of his incompetence. I have made another deposit in your account. I hope it is sufficient. At least your team suffered no casualties in the crash. ¡À

26240:
I trust this letter finds you safe and in control of your fate. ¡À ¡À Yours truly, ¡À Enrico Chivaldori

26880:
Pilot Found

27520:
I do not know how this will make you feel, but a pair of eyeglasses similar to the ones the pilot wore were found in a bloodcat den. They were found next to a pile of bones and a small quantity of narcotics. ¡À ¡À Enrico Chivaldori ¡À

29440:
Many of the countries in this part of the world have also expressed their relief over the destruction of the missile facility. We all have no doubt that nothing good was to come from these rockets. Ricci Mining and Exploration would have only held them over our heads like a dark cloud. ¡À

An Even Better Offer from M.E.R.C.

Hello there, ¡À ¡À Doing business with M.E.R.C has it's advantages. Like receiving this message from the owner of the agency himself, rather than some flunky, has-been, ex-mercenary, who barely saw action even in his prime. That's right! ¡À

121600:
You're dealing direct, and I'm here to respond to your needs. That's why I'm able to offer you a free, official, M.E.R.C. wristwatch the next time you hire from the More Economical Recruitment Center. And let me tell you, this timepiece is something special. ¡À
