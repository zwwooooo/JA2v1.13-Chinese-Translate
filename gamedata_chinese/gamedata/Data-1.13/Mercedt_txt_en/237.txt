Let's not be overconfident, I'm getting a bad feeling about this place.

There's nothing quite like stiffing the guy that stiffed you. Thanks!

19200:
No can do! That cloud over your head's gotten way too dark for me!

19680:
This one's ours to win. All we have to do is protect this with our lives.

20160:
Maybe you'd have better luck if we stood still?

20640:
This thing is malfunctioning.

21120:
I would never abandon my men, nor would they allow it! If it's time to move on, we're going as a group!

22080:
We're running things now!

22560:
You could be discharged for that!

23040:
You could be discharged for that!

23520:
Came across one! It smells like Reuban!

25920:
It looks doable. Just give me a couple of minutes to fill out some paperwork, and I'll get back to you.

26400:
I want to fire off a shot while this bird won't know what hit him.

26880:
I'm in combat!

27360:
I should have been able to handle it.

27840:
You're a real piece of work!

35040:
Sure I'll go back to work for you.

35520:
This thing is malfunctioning.

I think we should get an explosive's guy down here to take a look at this.

I'm gasping for air... Too tired to swim...

37440:
Colonel Kelly reporting for duty, Commander.

38400:
I wish I could, but I'm building an extension on my house!

38880:
If I wanted more money, i've told you straight out, I'm a professional. Greenbucks aren't gonna change my mind!

39360:
I'm gone! This place is a crap shoot and you're shooting crap! I'll make myself available when you manage to actually chalk up a successful mission!

39840:
And you'll have to deal with it, because there's no more dealing with me.

40320:
Keep trying... I'm about to finish off the roof. I could be available soon.

40800:
I think you're making a mistake... If you change your mind, you know where to contact me.

41280:
Unusually Ruthless Reuban... Crazy Reuban... Trimmer of the family tree. You can call him whatever you want, but I ain't working with him!

42720:
You're in the running, but you're going to have to increase the amount if you want to stay there.

43200:
Who could refuse such a gift?

43680:
Consider me on duty!

45600:
I'm a professional! Greenbacks aren't going to change the way I feel about you!

46080:
Okay, I'll say it again...

46560:
You'd better put out the call for blood donors.

47040:
You can't be foolish enough to think you can win this without me?

47520:
Listening to you has been a mistake! One I won't repeat!

48000:
What are you doing bringing crazy Reuban down here? Get rid him, or I'll quit!

50880:
Okay, I'll say it again...

51360:
You're shy a couple of greenbacks!

51840:
In times of trouble, they call me Kick-Ass Kelly!

52320:
You'll really have to prove yourself before I'll sign on!

52800:
Normally, I don't even listen to bribes, but I like ya... So, I'll give you one last chance at making me an offer I can't refuse.

53280:
Excellent choice... You're starting to look serious about winning this thing!

53760:
Spare me the sob stories! I just want to get out of here!

55200:
Listen doorknob, I've already been worked over by you!

55680:
Wouldn't you know it. I was just about to call you back when another job offer came in. Now... I'm looking for signing bonus.
