2880:
Close call.

3360:
I gotta find a crapper.

3840:
I'm a little flustered.

6720:
Can't get up... I've got... multiple injuries...  I need medical attention... now!

7200:
Anita's dead! She was the first woman I truly loved. I'm gonna kill the person responsible!

13440:
You messed with the wrong broad buckaroo!

13920:
Hurl won't be taking up any more of my time, the peculent pain in the ass.

15360:
I could kill him twice.

15840:
I gotta find a crapper.

16800:
Let's get down to work.

17280:
You're outta lunch.

17760:
One of us has got to go.

18240:
I've been doing this since I was in school.

18720:
That fast-talking shrimp!

19200:
We came up short soldier.

19680:
If you don't think a woman should be allowed in combat, I'd be more than willing to show you how you hadn't thought everything out.

20160:
Close call.

20640:
Forget it soldier!

21120:
I'm not much into this 'buy my silence' stuff. Especially not when I'm being demeaned.

21600:
Who needs men, right?

22080:
It won't mean anything when you're dead.

22560:
You remind me of patriotic puss.

23040:
I find it hard to believe you've done this before.

23520:
That guy looks a lot like Hurl... it is Cutter!

24480:
I'm the one who talked Anita into joining A.I.M.

25920:
There are other inquiries soldier.

26400:
Doing in one of our own is a little unorthodox, but...

26880:
Get your unskilled hands off me!

27360:
I have some experience at it, but I'm by no means an expert.

27840:
Protect her from any unnecessary danger.

28320:
I've run into some goons.

28800:
We're gonna have to do it again.

29280:
It looks like we got the best of them on this arrangement.

30240:
I wish I could kill him.

30720:
You're ordering me to kill a sister?

31200:
They never stood a chance.

31680:
I'm not comfortable with this.

32160:
And you can forget about using any of your underhanded methods to settle this matter soldier.

32640:
Puss!

33120:
You're a competent commander soldier. It was good to serve for you.

33600:
I don't believe we'll be seeing any more of those animals.

35040:
A cause I believe in.

35520:
I'm not having any luck getting this thing to work.

36000:
There's something odd about it.

36480:
The ground looks dangerous around here.

36960:
I'm swallowing water... I won't make it!

37440:
You owe us soldier. We came through for you.

38400:
You will have to show more commitment to the people you hire if you ever want me to consider working for you.

38880:
You're allowing the enemy to take all the glory. I don't want my name assocciated with your lost cause.

39360:
I thought I was clear when I left. I won't be going back!

39840:
I've been working too hard. I'm gonna have to pass on your offer.

40320:
My apologies for the inconvenience soldier. If your the only one who asks you can consider me in soldier. Let's get down to work.

40800:
Just remember, when you need me I won't be back.

41280:
I'm not Cutter's personal physician. If you want that candy butt on your team, you can't have me.

42720:
It won't be long before out of time.

43200:
OK, I'll give you a short leash.

43680:
Consider me in.

44160:
I accept your offer. It will allow me to keep an eye on Anita and protect her from any unnecessary danger.

45600:
You have absolutely no commitment to the team or any of it's members. I can't stay here any longer.

46080:
Like I've already said...

46560:
You can't even dream of paying me soldier.

47040:
It was one of my better assingments soldier.

47520:
I'm leaving before my good name becomes associated with this lost cause.

48000:
One of us has got to go. I can't spend my days dispensing medical advice to that gomer Hurl Cutter. I'm not his personal physician.

49440:
I have a relationship to consider here soldier.

50880:
Like I've already said...

51360:
You were too restrained in your offering, I... I won't be able to help you.

51840:
Let's put it behind us and get down to work.

52320:
I've been doing this since I was in school and though I... I hide my age well, I assure you I've got quite a few years of experience.

52800:
We're no further ahead.

53280:
You're fighting for a cause I believe in.

53760:
Forget it soldier. You're to stingy to converse with.

54240:
I'm not Cutter's personal physician. Sometimes I wish I could kill him twice.

55200:
It's time to head for home.

55680:
Open the piggy bank soldier.
