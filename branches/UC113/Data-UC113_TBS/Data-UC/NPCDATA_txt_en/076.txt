Welcome to my bar. I understand a friend recommended me. It is often the case; news of my skills with the drinks travel far and wide.

480:
I prepare many exotic drinks. Gossip is also on the menu, in addition to reliable information.

960:
Welcome friends, please be seated. My name is Herve De Santos, now what can I serve you?

1440:
I recommend you try a Pink Handbag, the latest rage in Danubia. My creation of course.

1920:
Thank you, gifts are always welcome, but I have that already.

2400:
If you are interested in finding General Marco, I overheard his driver say he intends to tour several new checkpoints and minefields recently installed on roads leading to the capital.

2880:
Why do you say that? I'm trying to help you!

3360:
My life is rewarding enough already. Having a talent for mixing exotic cocktails is raking in a fortune plus an ever growing clientelle. Sorry, but I must decline your offer.

3840:
Blood aarrrrggghh, I need a doctor!

4320:
Take care on the roads and watch out for army patrols.  There are other customers waiting. I must get back to my duties, now. Goodbye.

I'm too busy ducking bullets to talk right now.

14880:
You will find military convoys on the roads since the revolt began. They are trying to isolate the capital from rebel attacks by setting up checkpoints and minefields.

15360:
The army has several heavily defended bases and SAM sites around Danubia. Additionally, there are four patrol boat bases along the coast. All good places to obtain advanced weapons.

15840:
It is known that General Marcos' mistress lives in a luxurious resort just north of Drake. He often drives from the capital in an armored black limousine, always heavily escorted.

16320:
There are rumors of tanks being positioned on roads near and inside the capital itself. A SAM site protects Adrian in addition to two other bases on the city's outskirts.
