Let the games begin.

960:
Gotta turn things around.

1440:
Bug!

1920:
Blowing those things away is gonna be a whole lot of fun. Hahhaha.

2400:
Those bugs sure do get around.

2880:
Sure I heard a sound. A bad sound!

3360:
Whoa! Ain't nothin' I know that smells quite like that!

3840:
Starting to smell a rumble.

4320:
Wouldn't mind killing me another bug right about now.

4800:
Hahhaha. These bugs are going to get it.

5280:
What's that?

5760:
Is it worth it?

6240:
Bullets be handy, man.

6720:
Oh, man... I'm toast.

7200:
Fox bought it? That's too bad. She was a hot chick.

8160:
They got Bull? Man... musta used an elephant gun.

8640:
Clued out, man.

9120:
Misfire.

9600:
They got my number.

10080:
I've been beaten by chicks worse than that.

10560:
Hahaha... You'll have to do better than that.

11040:
Ain't looking easy, Scooter.

11520:
Sight of my own blood makes me nauseous, man.

12000:
I'm zapped. Need to crash.

12480:
Ehhho - Man... I gotta cut back on the beer and cigarettes.

12960:
Suck my exhaust!

13440:
Hahaha... Wiped out.

13920:
Biff's driving me nuts! Maybe I could just rip out his vocal cords. Course, I'd have to catch him first.

15360:
There... that wasn't so tough.

15840:
Not much chance of picking up the pieces there.

16320:
I ain't crazy about tight places, man. This place is givin' me the sweats.

16800:
I'm done here.

17280:
Forget it, Scooter!

17760:
You're a carcass now, sweetheart.

18240:
Hahaha... grandma roach is cooked.

18720:
What a doorknob.

19200:
I'm really not into this...

19680:
Dealing with idiots down here.

20160:
Sky bandits!

20640:
The stuff I'm using should be in a museum.

21600:
Piss me off! Some people just think they're better than others. And they're usually wearing suits.

22080:
I'm catching on.

22560:
That ain't the way I'd go about it.

23040:
I won't tell anyone, Scooter.

23520:
Ah, man. What were you thinkin' when you brought that chicken boy, Biff, down here. His whining gives me migraines.

24480:
Talent and beauty. Gotta love it.

25440:
My man Bull!

25920:
Ahhh... not sure what I'm doing yet. We'll talk again.

26400:
All right! The chance to kill Mike!

26880:
Flamin' eyeballs! God damn thing's blinded me.

27360:
This ain't gonna happen.

27840:
Someone with a head on their shoulders.

28320:
There's rivals hanging out in the area.

28800:
We haven't eliminated the other club yet. Nobody get stupid!

29280:
Don't mess with the vest, Scooter!

29760:
It's you and me, baby.

30240:
There's the kid. Gonna drag him back to his mother by his short hairs.

30720:
Rebel force! Right on, Scooter. Let me tell ya, I'm a rebel from way back. Your business is my business, Mike. I'm your man.

31200:
Last puke wasted. I don't even know why they show up.

31680:
Hey! Some of the parts is missing here, Scooter.

32160:
You know, had I had the time, I woulda taught the chick a thing or two, maybe we coulda salvaged her. But something had to be done and done quick for the sake of the kids.

32640:
Seatcovers!

33120:
This is the life, Scooter. Just kick back, grab a brew and take it all in. We kicked some nasty ass! Cause ya put a nasty group of guys together. Catch ya on life's highway, man.

33600:
They took off, man...

34080:
Gonna do a short coma, man.

34560:
All right. I'm back standing vertical. Gonna finish up what I was doing.

35040:
I'm in on that, Scooter.

35520:
What I'm carrying here is piece of garbage. And I can't get nothing done with a piece of garbage.

36000:
Sit tight. This thing's loaded and ready to blow.

36480:
Hey, watch your step. Enemy's been on their knees playing around.

36960:
Scoot...errr... I can't keep... my head...longer...

37440:
Road trip's over, man.

38400:
We got a problem, Scooter. From what I hear, you haven't got a clue what you're doing.

38880:
I could flip a coin as to whether I come back from Arulco alive. I'm looking for better odds than that, Scooter.

39360:
Could use the cash, but I gotta rally, man.

39840:
Headed home, Scooter. Made other plans.

40320:
Nails. Talk to me, I'll listen to ya later.

40800:
Keep my name in mind, Scooter.

41280:
If I spend another minute with Biff, I'll kill him. It's that simple. So out of respect for Speck, I'm gonna pass on your offer.

42720:
We're coming up on the end of this contract, Scooter. What's the crystal ball telling ya?

43200:
Yeah... I could get into it for a little longer.

43680:
We got a deal. I'd shake your hand but these contraptions ain't quite at that point yet.

44160:
Hey, the Fox is in Arulco, I'm in Arulco. You can bank on that.

45120:
With Bull signed on, I'm signed on. He's kick-ass! I like that.

45600:
Scooter, I'm gonna go home, take something strong, crash on the couch with the TV on, and forget I was ever here.

46080:
Concentrate, Scooter. I was telling ya...

46560:
Your bank is making like they don't know ya, Scooter. Consider everything, ...off.

47040:
Ya needed a specialist, huh, Scooter. Someone to get the job done and get out.

47520:
I could flip a coin as to whether I come back from Arulco alive. Looking for better odds than that, Scooter.

48000:
If I spend another minute with Biff, I'll kill him. It's that simple. So out of respect for Speck, I'm gonna pass on your offer.

49440:
Hey, the Fox is in Arulco, I'm in Arulco. You can bank on that.

50400:
With Bull signed on, I'm signed on. He's kick-ass! I like that.

50880:
Concentrate, Scooter. I was telling ya...

51360:
Your bank is making like they don't know ya, Scooter. Consider everything, ...off.

51840:
Nails.

52320:
Not too many people know this, but I can open just about anything you can lock.

52800:
I got shit to do...

53280:
What we talking, Scooter?

53760:
The silence is killing me, Scooter. I gotta run.

54240:
Okay, I'll work with Biff this time but keep in mind that I hate his guts. The less I see him the better. He irritates the crap out of me.

55200:
It's almost time for me to split, Scooter.

55680:
When the tough get going, the price goes up. I gotta new bottom line, Scooter.
