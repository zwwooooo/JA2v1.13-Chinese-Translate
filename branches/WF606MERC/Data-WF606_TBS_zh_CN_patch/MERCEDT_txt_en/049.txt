0:
Encounter.

480:
Time to earn our pay.

960:
I've got a situation.

1440:
More head lice.

1920:
Looks like huge head lice. Though I doubt there's a treatment for it.

2400:
More evidence of our lice problem.

2880:
That sound didn't come from any of us.

3360:
In my opinion, that's the smell of the lice.

3840:
Getting bad vibes around here.

4320:
Can't get those giant head lice off my mind. Well, you know what I mean.

4800:
I don't know if I can handle these myself!

5280:
Is that worth picking up?

5760:
Worth something, maybe?

6240:
Ammo time.

6720:
Don't know if I can... can survive like this.

7200:


7680:


8160:
I've lost friends before in combat of one kind or another. But never a woman. You were a special woman, Meltdown. I'm going to miss you.

8640:
What was I doing again?

9120:
I've got a jammed gun here.

9600:
I'm being blitzed!

10080:
I've had clients rough me up far worse than this.

10560:
That kind of risk comes with the territory.

11040:
Possiblities are slim to none.

11520:
Getting blood on my uniform.

12000:
I'm going to start making mistakes unless I'm allowed to sleep.

12480:
I have to slow down a bit.

12960:
Target is down.

13440:
Scratch a head lice.

13920:
Static is infantile. He's a danger to this outfit.

14400:
Larry Roachburn should not be allowed to handle a weapon any more than a child should.

14880:
Nails is a renegade. Renegades are only out for themselves. They're entirely untrustworthy. He doesn't belong here.

15360:
I got Mike. He wasn't as tough as he liked to think.

15840:
Why do people have such a morbid fascination with this? It's disgusting and tragic.

16320:


16800:
Time to move on to something else.

17280:
Absolutely not.

17760:
Let's hope there are no more like her...though I doubt it, I have dated a few.

18240:
I hope that puts an end to the head lice.

18720:
That lout has no business among civilized men and women.

19200:
I don't approve of the way this outfit's being run. And I won't stand for much more of it.

19680:
Most of these mercenaries aren't professionals. They're stupid, brutish, and too interested in racking up a high body count.

20160:
They've called in their pathetic air force!

20640:
This equipment is substandard. Expect a substandard job.

21120:
Take comfort in my presence. I am capable of leading us through anything.

21600:
Americans think they're such hot shit! They'll probably rack up more gunfire victims in any one of their major cities than we will today.

22080:
Never too old to learn.

22560:
I doubt that stratagem will bear close scrutiny.

23040:
That result was entirely foreseeable.

23520:
Fortunately for you, Static was not a part of the original team, or I would never have agreed to join. Just keep him away from me.

24000:
As far as I'm concerned, Larry Roachburn is unwelcome on this team. I would have refused the assignment at the outset had I known he'd be admitted.

24480:


24960:


25440:
I've really come to like Meltdown. Talent is so sexy.

25920:
I've yet to decide whether or not this outfit meets my expectations.

26400:
Mike! Mike is here...working for them? We're going to have to kill Mike.

26880:
Bad situation! Some type of acid. I am sightless.

27360:
It appears to be beyond my capabilities.

27840:
I'm not sure about him.

28320:
I have confirmation of enemy forces in this sector.

28800:
Some of them have managed to flee. We should be prepared for a second assault just in case.

29280:


29760:
I cannot convey just how good it feels.

30240:
I think we've located the delinquent teenager.

30720:
We are completely prepared and confident, Miguel, and accept your welcome and the challenges that lie ahead.

31200:
Well, that's it. They've run out of forces in this area.

31680:
Apparently, the shipping department is not working toward their quality objectives, or... quantities disappeared at some point during transport.

32160:
Soldiers have to make some hard choices. This wasn't one of them. There were no other options.

32640:
Bobcat. Remain calm.

33120:
Before this, I was considering retirement, maybe some quiet time on the beaches of Brazil. Now I'm not quite sure. It was a pleasure.

33600:
It appears they've pulled out. They're most likely afraid.

34080:
To maintain my high quality standards, I'll be sleeping before I do any more work.

34560:
On duty.

35040:
Precisely what I was thinking.

35520:
With properly maintained equipment, this would not occur.

36000:
I must exercise prudence. A sound knowledge of explosives would be helpful here.

36480:
They didn't do a good job of disguising their intentions. Have to watch my step.

36960:
I suppose... this is the end... Help me!

37440:
My location is as requested.

37920:


38400:
Your reputation as a leader who lacks some basic skills is, unfortunately, borne out by your record. I'd need to see some improvement before I'd consider working with you.

38880:
I can't see signing with you at the present. Too high a percentage of your charges are never seen again.

39360:
Another time. I'm consulting on a new security setup in Moscow.

39840:
No, I'm off to draw up blueprints for a state-of-the-art vault system for the Japanese government. I'll need more advance notice next time.

40320:
You've found Stephen Rothman. If you leave a message for me, I can return your call.

40800:
Thank you for the work.

41280:
Any proposal involving my working on the same team as Static is unacceptable.

41760:
Surely you can't expect me to work with Larry Roachburn. Mercenary work requires maturity and dependability. He has neither. I can't accept.

42240:
I can't function alongside Nails. Aside from his obvious physical unsuitability for the task, I believe he's a renegade out for himself. You can't have us both.

42720:
My stint is nearly up. Shall we talk about renewal?

43200:
I accept the renewal.

43680:
I accept the contract with hopes for good things to come.

44160:


44640:


45120:
I'm troubled by some elements of your record, but I've developed a degree of faith in Meltdown. Based on her trust in you, I'll take the chance.

45600:
No, I've had enough of this treatment.

46080:
What I said was...

46560:
I charge more than you can afford to pay.

47040:
Thank you for the work.

47520:
I can't see signing with you at the present. Too high a percentage of your charges are never seen again.

48000:
Any proposal involving my working on the same team as Static is unacceptable.

48480:
Surely you can't expect me to work with Larry Roachburn. Mercenary work requires maturity and dependability. He has neither. I can't accept.

48960:
I can't function alongside Nails. Aside from his obvious physical unsuitability for the task, I believe he's a renegade out for himself. You can't have us both.

49440:


49920:


50400:
I'm troubled by some elements of your record, but I've developed a degree of faith in Meltdown. Based on her trust in you, I'll take the chance.

50880:
What I said was...

51360:
I charge more than you can afford to pay.

51840:
Stephen Rothman.

52320:
I consider myself a security specialist, but if you review my records, you'll see that it's by no means my only area of expertise.

52800:
You're wasting my time.

53280:
And you are proposing a duration of?

53760:
You're welcome to call once you have something to say. Good day.

54240:
I'm willing to put up with Static for the moment, but I make no guarantees. Just keep him well out of my sight, and there might not be any problems.

54720:


55200:
Be aware that our current agreement is nearing completion.

55680:
If you review my records, I am certain you'll agree that my increased capabilities more than offset the price increase for my services.
