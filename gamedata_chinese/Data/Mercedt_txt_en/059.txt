0:
There's the enemy.

480:
The army! I knew we'd see them sooner or later.

960:
I've got my hands full.

1440:
Another of Deidranna's pets.

1920:
Deidranna's got to be behind those things. Mother nature isn't that diabolical.

2400:
We have to put an end to those things.

2880:
What was that?

3360:
Their odor is as sweet as their intentions.

3840:
Trouble's coming. I can feel it.

4320:
This place, it-it looks like a hangout for those things.

4800:
Those things are flippin' pains in the ass!

5280:
There's stuff.

5760:
Look here!

6240:
Gun's out of bullets.

6720:
I'm in serious pain... send a letter to my family in Brooklyn. Tell them I died bravely - died fighting for the oppressed.

7200:
Poor Dimitri - he fought for his family. He fought selflessly for his country.

7680:
Miguel's dead! This is terrible! Terrible news! Who will rule Arulco when it is finally free?

8640:
I'm not sure I understood.

9120:
Flippin' gun doesn't want to work!

9600:
Need a distraction!

10080:
Maybe I should just go home.

10560:
Whew... too close for comfort.

11040:
I'd be really pleased with myself if I could hit it.

11520:
I've been hit.

12000:
Ahh... falling asleep on my feet.

12480:
The pace is too much! I have to slow down.

12960:
Take that!

13440:
One thing less!

14880:
That Malice person makes my skin crawl.

15840:
Oh my God! That's so revolting!

16320:
I'll go in, but I was never what you'd call a fish in water. I like dry land.

16800:
I'm all done.

17280:
I have other plans.

17760:
I've dreamt of this moment for years. It feels wonderful!

18240:
God! I hope that was the mother of all those things.

18720:
Some people just haven't got a clue.

19200:
I thought this would be exciting. I thought I'd be working with professionals. How naive.

19680:
Don't be fooled. Not everyone in Arulco is like that.

20160:
Flippin' air attack! When will the harrassment cease?

20640:
I can't believe this! I got better supplies working with the rebel force.

21600:
I know I am American, but I dislike them. You don't see American forces down here liberating these people, do you? Who do you think armed Deidranna?

22080:
I'm learning.

22560:
That doesn't make any sense.

23040:
I'm not surprised.

24480:
Good show, Dimitri!

24960:
That's why Miguel is the leader.

26880:
I can't see a flippin' thing.

27360:
I'm useless. Maybe someone else can help.

27840:
People like that are why I stayed in Arulco.

28320:
We have company. Deidranna's men are around.

28800:
I'm sure we didn't find all of Deidranna's men.

29760:
Now - that was special!

30240:
It's Joey, the runaway kid. Let's get him.

30720:
Fine by me. But I don't think you're making the wisest decision.

31200:
We've eliminated all of Deidranna's men in this area.

31680:
Someone's thieving the stuff. And that's something... Pablo has a reputation for.

32160:
That's a step forward for Arulco. Trust me when I say that the people will appreciate this little act.

32640:
Oh God... It's one of those bloodcats.

33120:
You know, much as I had my doubts, Miguel believed in you. And now I know why. Nice work.

33600:
We're clear. They must've pulled out.

34080:
Grab some sleep, and I'll get back to work.

34560:
Still a little fuzzy, but I'm back working.

35040:
I was just thinking that.

35520:
Oh, this figures. Piece of junk is broken.

36000:
Whoa! I got something wired here.

36480:
Careful. That's a nasty little how-do-you-do.

36960:
God! Get me outta here! Help! No... I... don't...

37440:
I made it. Let's do something already.
