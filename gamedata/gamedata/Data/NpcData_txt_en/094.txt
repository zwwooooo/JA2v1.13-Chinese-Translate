I'm Damon! Kingpin's personal bodyguard. Who the hell are you?

480:
You're back.

960:
Ya, whatever.

1440:
That's nice.

1920:
I don't want it.

2400:
Give it a rest.

2880:
Threaten me again, and I'll be the last person you ever threaten!

Already got a job.

3840:
Heal me up, so I can kick your ass.

4320:
Why don't you go play your little war games somewhere else.

4800:
I can't be bought.

5280:
Kingpin is expecting you. You'll find him in his gaming room to your right.

5760:
Oh, yeah?

6240:
Suck on this, sleezeball!

6720:
You're not expected, so you're not welcome.
