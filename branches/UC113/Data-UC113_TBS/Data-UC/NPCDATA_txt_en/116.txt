You guys must be the mercenaries. Glad you made it.

480:
Do you have the decoded information? Great!

You've come a long way since landing at Atremo. Seems you left a pile of the Queen's soldier's corpses knee deep in every town you've visited. Outstanding result!

1440:
Let's get straight to business. Do you have the decoded information? Great, hand it over.

1920:
I need the decoded information, not that.

2400:
Outstanding work! Here, take this key card. Go back to sector P6. There's a secret entrance to the Queen's bunker in the locked building. This key card opens the door.

2880:
Hey, cut the crap! You're here on serious business.

No thanks. I'm already up to my neck in clandestine activity and shooting people.

3840:
I'm wounded and need a dressing. Have you guys got a medic with you?

4320:
You guys came through like professionals. Outstanding! Take care and good luck with the Queen. Put a bullet into her for me. Goodbye and thanks, our nation is in your debt.

4800:
Toast all those goons first, then we can talk.
