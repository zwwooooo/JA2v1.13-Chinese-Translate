Hello.

480:
We meet again. How nice.

960:
I understand the necessity of war. But it just seems this whole thing could have been settled... with an assassination.

1440:
You're the hired guns I've heard of. I have a lot of respect for your line of work.

1920:
I don't want it.

2400:
I came down here to get away from it all. Finding myself in the middle of a war makes me nervous as hell. The Americans will come. They always come to a war! I don't like the Americans.

2880:
In case you hadn't noticed, I have a gun. Perhaps we can talk like professionals here.

3360:
No. Wasn't part of my plans.

3840:
I need a doctor...

4320:
Good talking to you.

4800:
Appreciated.

5280:
You should have backed out when you had the chance!

5760:
Stop! Okay, you know who I am. We can make a deal. How would you like to have the use of my talents? I'm an excellent sniper. Very comfortable on rooftops. Can pick off just about anything you want.

6240:
I tell you what... I'll give you a week. You get the services of Richard Ruttwen, free of charge, for one week. Then, we're even, and I walk. If you know anything about my reputation, you won't pass on the chance.

6720:
Okay... We got a deal. Just treat me like any of the others.

7200:
You deceitful bastard!

7680:
Don't be expecting me to do anything for it.

8160:
Still a lot of fighting going on here. Not a good time to be talking.
