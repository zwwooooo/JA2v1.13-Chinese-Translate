There's an enemy here!

480:
I've made contact! Enemy unaware of my presence.

960:
I've made contact with a couple of enemies!

1440:
I've made contact!

1920:
I've made contact!

2400:
We have to be careful

2880:
I have to stay more alert...

3360:
We have to be careful

3840:
We have to be careful

4320:
I am beginning to wonder if there are any enemies.

4800:
Enemies!

5280:
There seems to be something over here.

5760:
There seems to be something over here.

6240:
Ammo! I'm out of ammo!

6720:
Been hit real bad... Can't move... Getting weaker...

9120:
Gun's jammed!

9600:
I'm being fired at!

10080:
Might need medical attention!

10560:
That is nowhere close

11040:
I'll probably miss.

11520:
I'm bleeding! I need to patch myself up.

12000:
I'm tired. I need a break...

12480:
I'm tired. I need a break...

12960:
Not a chance!

13440:
Not a chance!

15360:
It is going very well for us!

15840:
Oh my God!

16320:
My father was a loser. I can't stay here any longer!

16800:
We did it.

17280:
I don't think this is an appropriate time!

18240:
Not a chance!

19200:
I almost feel bad about getting paid for this.

19680:
You guys are almost too funny to shoot.

20160:
So when does the fighting start?

20640:
I can't seem to get it to work.

21120:
Well... It had to be one of us.

22080:
That seems satisfactory!

22560:
I should have packed a lunch. Looks like there's plenty of opportunity for a picnic.

23040:

25920:
Better next time...

26400:
I've made contact!

26880:
Oh my God!

27360:
There better be no mention of this incident in my record!

28320:
We'd better be careful. The ground doesn't seem right.

28800:
I am beginning to wonder if there are any enemies.

29760:
Not a chance!

31200:
I think that was the last of that team.

32160:
It is going very well for us!

32640:
I've made contact!

33120:
There really is no better feeling than coming out on top.

33600:
I am beginning to wonder if there are any enemies.

34080:
I'm tired. I need a break...

34560:
There's no need to push me!

35040:
I'll need at least another day.

35520:
I guess I could use more experience at this!

36000:
It looks like it's been tampered with.

36480:
It looks like it's been tampered with.

36960:
I'm out of breath... Going under... water!

37440:
I'm ready when you are!

38400:
This is pointless! I'm finished negotiating with you.

38880:
You should be looking to hire a mortician - not a doctor!

39360:
I'm not that interested... My father was a loser! And you're a little down on your luck yourself!

39840:
Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking for something a little more permanent!

40320:
I've had other inquiries. I'll get back to you shortly.

40800:
I look forward to working with you again.

42720:
We running out of time!

43200:
It's great to be appreciated. I'm ready when you are!

43680:
I'm in!

45600:
When you get serious about the team you want, you can give me a call. But for now, I am outta here!

46080:
Like I said before...

46560:
You appear to lack the funds necessary to hire me.

47040:
And, just in case you don't remember, it is no longer negotiable.

47520:
I've had enough! There are way too many of us dying down here!

50880:
Like I said before...

51360:
You appear to lack the funds necessary to hire me.

51840:
I revived two mercenaries, both of whom had been dead for well over five minutes. What more could you ask for from your team physician?

52320:
Don't judge Larry too harshly. He's got a problem. I just wish he would listen to me. I can get him some help...

52800:
I am interested, but I believe you could do better.

53280:
You really don't know what you want, do you?

53760:
Maybe we can work something out next time.

55200:
For personal reasons, I've decided to take the day off.

55680:
My services appear to be in demand. I'll be accepting the assignment that offers the highest signing bonus.
