0:
Sighting.

480:
Here we go. Time to lock and load.

960:
I have a serious situation here!

1440:
Shrimp!

1920:
Good lord! Talk about your jumbo shrimp!

2400:
Those shrimp have been here.

2880:
Someone or something just made a noise.

3360:
<sniff> I'd recognize that smell anywhere: really old shrimp.

3840:
I don't like this. It's the calm before the storm.

4320:
Something tells me there's shrimp on the menu.

4800:
Who the hell ordered the shrimp?

5280:
Is that something valuable?

5760:
Might be usable.

6240:
Gun's out of ammo.

6720:
I'm down for the count.

7200:
Charlene... I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry... don't think her insurance covered acts of war.

8640:
What was I doin'?

9120:
Gun jam!

9600:
Feels like I'm being ganged-up on!

10080:
Ooh, that stings.

10560:
Woah, thought my number was up.

11040:
Can't recommend it, not without magic bullets.

11520:
I'm bleeding.

12000:
Doubt I can take another step 'til I get some sleep.

12480:
I'm winded.

12960:
Snuffed one.

13440:
That shrimp's sliced and diced.

14880:
Frank Hennessy's cruisin' for a bruisin' if he doesn't learn to keep his hands to his own damn self.

15360:
The invincible Mike wasn't so invincible after all!

15840:
When I see something like that, I begin to think L.A. wasn't all that bad.

16800:
I'm available.

17280:
I ain't taking those kind of orders.

17760:
She was beggin' for it.

18240:
Hasta la vista, Momma.

18720:
That pig's got the brains of a soap dish.

19200:
Jackass doesn't have the brains to put me in charge. It can only go downhill from here.

19680:
It's like they picked out every screwed-up merc in the business, and then added me so they'd have a token competent guy.

20160:
Fighters overhead!

20640:
We should give this stinkin' equipment to the enemy. Then we'd have the advantage.

21120:
Everyone on this squad has SOMEthing to learn. But they're not paying enough attention to me.

22080:
I use every opportunity to learn.

22560:
That plan's got a hole you could drive a truck through.

23040:
I would never have concocted such an ill-conceived plan.

24480:
Raven's the best. I'd rather have her in my court than anyone else.

25920:
Whaddaya say we put that off 'til we see how things shake out?

26400:
Holy cow, it's Mike! I hadn't counted on this!

26880:
Vision's impaired! Eyes are hurtin' bad.

27360:
Nobody on the planet can do this!

27840:
The people here are a lot easier going than in L.A.

28320:
The sector has felons.

28800:
Be cautious! We have unfinished business lurking in this sector.

29760:
Superior craftsmanship always gives my weapon the final word.

30240:
Looks like the kid we're supposed to be watching out for.

30720:
The situation calls for extreme measures, and we're the extreme answer, Miguel. Good to be on board.

31200:
Every felon on this block has been dealt with. We can move out.

31680:
If the guy who rifled through this was here, I'd shoot his kneecaps out. Stuff's missing.

32160:
She had it coming. Pretty much hung out a sign: Shoot me. The kids will be better off for it.

32640:
Serious cat sighted.

33120:
Solid leadership makes a solid team. A solid team can get through anything. We just proved it.

33600:
Whadda surprise. They ran for the hills. We can breathe easy for a bit.

34080:
I'm feeling incompetent. I'll take a quick nap and get back on the job.

34560:
Picking up where I left off.

35040:
Make that another.

35520:
Poor craftsmanship in action. Buy American, that's what I always say.

36000:
We'll need a plan to deal with this. It's hot!

36480:
Easy. Looks like somebody has rearranged the ground cover.

36960:
Wish I had my... my floaters.

37440:
I'm at the scene. Need a plan.

38400:
I insist on strong, competent leadership. I'm not confident that I'd get that with you.

38880:
You leave too many bodies behind. I'm not going to be one of them.

39360:
Would if I could, but I can't. I've got a bowling tournament coming up.

39840:
Can't. I'm running a training session for the National Guard. Next time, don't wait 'til the last minute.

40320:
This is Ron Higgens. I'll be out of the office all day today, but if you leave a message at the end of this recording, I'll be happy to return your call.

40800:
I guess we're done here. Best of luck to you in the future.

42240:
Can't help you. I've had some personal disagreements with Hitman. Until we've got it settled, I'd just as soon not put my life in his hands.

42720:
I'm up for renewal. Wanna work out an extension?

43200:
Great. Glad to know it's working out.

43680:
Excellent. I'll be there as soon as possible.

44160:
Raven and I complement each other perfectly. Where she goes, I'll gladly go as well.

45600:
After that last stint, I wouldn't work with you again for ten times the money.

46080:
I'll repeat it in English. I said...

46560:
The spirit's willing, but your wallet is weak.

47040:
I won't try to change your mind, but I think the problem is probably with YOU, not with ME.

47520:
You leave too many bodies behind. I'm not going to be one of them.

48960:
Can't help you. I've had some personal disagreements with Hitman. Until we've got it settled, I'd just as soon not put my life in his hands.

49440:
Raven and I complement each other perfectly. Where she goes, I'll gladly go as well.

50880:
I'll repeat it in English. I said...

51360:
The spirit's willing, but your wallet is weak.

51840:
Y'ello.

52320:
I prefer to work with Raven whenever possible. Just so you know.

52800:
What are we waitin' for?

53280:
Daily? Longer? What're we talking about?

53760:
Just call me whenever you get it together. I've got things to do.

55200:
Just wanted to mention that this contract ends soon.

55680:
My improved abilities have given me the opportunity to increase my fees. I'm certain that I merit it.
