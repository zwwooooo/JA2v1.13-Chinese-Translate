Hey, hey, hey! How did you get in here? This is a PRIVATE wildlife reserve. What I tolerate in this job! Ahh, if I get into trouble, it's going to be your ass, not mine.

480:
I'd like to remind you that this is a PRIVATE reserve.

960:
We HAD a nice facility here. Now Arulco is a regular United Nations... but we're not all getting along so well.

1440:
These working conditions, really, aren't acceptable, but I'm not going to say anything. What would they do anyway?

1920:
I don't want to be caught with it.

2400:
Nothing personal, but I gotta say if I hear another "bloody" or "right" or "cheerio," I'm going to.... I don't know, get... upset.

2880:
All right, all right! Calm down already. My nerves are bad enough as it is.

3360:
No, a battlefield is no place for me.

3840:
Get a... doctor.

4320:
I should get back to work.

4800:
That was a close one.

5280:
You fool!

5760:
Maybe you could settle things down first...

6240:
We do keep certain hours here at the refuge, and you'll have to leave the premises now.

6720:
As I mentioned, this is a PRIVATE facility. We protect the Bloodcats and research their activities. There isn't much more to tell you.

7200:
This is both a conservatory and a research facility for the Bloodcats. Arulco's the only place they're found. Now, if you wish to know more about Bloodcats, I suggest you take it up with one personally.

7680:
Look, do me a favor, and just pretend like you shot me or something. If the Queen finds out what I did, she'll do it herself. But, hey, she doesn't pay me enough to be honest.

8160:
Frankly, I'm just surprised you made it in here alive.

8640:
It feels good to let her secret out of the bag. It's a load off my chest. Honestly? I was getting sick of covering up for the bitch. Just... just don't say anything to get me caught.

9120:
Hey! The guns, the bloodcats, the guards? What's another threat to my life, pal. Besides, why would you shoot me when I might know something, hm?

9600:
You ever hear about random acts of kindness? Well, this might be a good time for one.

10080:
Hey. Why thank you. It's funny about money. Always makes me feel like talking.

10560:
But, for this, that's all you get. I FEEL like talking, but I'm not DOING it.

11040:
What are you trying to buy, a vowel? Time to get serious.

11520:
Wait, wait. I feel a thought coming on here.

12000:
See, downstairs, the Queen's got something brewing. It's research all right, but it doesn't have anything to do with the Bloodcats! She's got a, well, a secret weapons plant down there. Now, I'll let you in.

12480:
But don't you dare say word one about me and this little conversation. It never happened.

12960:
I'll take your money, but I have to tell you, at this point, it's all charitable donations on your part.

13440:
Hope you didn't say anything about, you know, our little arrangement.
