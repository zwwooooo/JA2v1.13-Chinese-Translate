0:
More bad news.

480:
They're heee-eere.

960:
My ass is grass!

1440:
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo...

1920:
God, that's awesome. Spielberg himself couldn't have come up with something like that. Wonder what he'd pay for some of its DNA.

2400:
I've seen enough movies to recognize the telltale signs of a mutant creature attack when I see one.

2880:
Uh-oh, I didn't like the sound of that.

3360:
<sniff> Ahh, I love the smell of mutant flatulence...

3840:
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

4320:
I've got that same sense of impending doom I got from the first two Alien movies. But not the third one. It sucked.

4800:
I'll never get out of this alive!

5280:
Any chance that thing's usable?

5760:
What do we have here?

6240:
Gun's empty.

6720:
I think I'm dying... I see a bright light... oh, God, tell me this is just special effects...

8640:
Whoa! Vertigo! Where was I?

9120:
What the... my gun's screwy!

9600:
I'll blow you all to kingdom-come!

10080:
Just like elementary school all over again.

10560:
Wow, your whole life really DOES flash before your eyes!

11040:
I don't feel confident about this one.

11520:
There's red stuff here... hey, it's blood... REAL blood... MY blood!

12000:
I can't go on without sleep. I'm not a robot, y'know.

12480:
I gotta stop and breathe for a minute. I tried smoking, you know.

12960:
Better you than me!

13440:
Hah! Back to the bottom of the food chain!

15840:
Wow... just like in "Scanners." That was too cool.

16320:
How does anyone concentrate in this heat? It's like working in a blast furnace!

16800:
Anything else?

17280:
No, man, no, no way, not me.

17760:
Holy cow, she's dead!

18240:
I did it. I DID IT! I'm gonna sell the movie rights and make a goddamn FORTUNE!

18720:
What a loser! Even I'm not THAT bad.

19200:
This is miserable. I can't wait to get outta here.

19680:
Buncha disgruntled Post Office rejects, that's what this team is.

20160:
Enemy planes approaching! We've had it!

20640:
Hey, let's sell these lousy supplies for scrap and split the take.

21120:
We're gonna die here. At least if we surrender, they might let us live.

22080:
It's a start, anyway.

22560:
Can you say "stupid"?

23040:
Just too clever to work.

25920:
I'm not even getting paid for this! So why am I laying my life on the line? Forget you. I'm taking a powder.

26880:
This is scary! I can't see anything!

27360:
How's about giving me something I CAN do.

27840:
He reminds me of somebody. Not really sure who...

28320:
There are enemy forces present in this sector.

28800:
I hate it when you know they're out there, yet all's quiet.

29760:
Just call me Harry. Dirty Harry!

30240:
That kid matches the description Mrs. Graham gave us. I bet any money that he's Joey.

30720:
Well, it's your decision. Should have gotten an autograph though. Someday, it'll be worth money. I'm telling you.

31200:
Last one down! That was better than Reservoir Dogs, man!

31680:
It's not all herrreeeee...

32160:
Trust me, in the script of life, she needed to be written out. We didn't have a choice.

32640:
Warning! Warning! Will Robinson!

33120:
And as the credits roll, our budding star sits sweating in the tropical heat imagining the air-conditioned day when his friends will say, "Yes, I knew that great man." I promise, I'll get you all backstage.

33600:
Ah, they took off. Extras. You can't count on them.

34080:
I need to sleep. I perform much better with my eyelids open.

34560:
Exactly what I needed. I'm picking up where I left off.

35040:
Yeah, me too!

35520:
The props here are useless. Gotta fix this.

36000:
Stand back. If there's one thing I know, this is a trap.

36480:
Whoa, careful pilgrim. Looks mighty suspicious 'round these parts.

36960:
Too... much... water... Bones...

37440:
I'm on location. Ready for the next scene.
