0:
Hostiles!

480:
There you are. I've been waiting for you.

960:
Knee-deep in bloody hell!

1440:
Dung beetle!

1920:
Bloody insane! I swear I was holding a magnifying glass to a dung beetle that had the legs of a rabbit.

2400:
Bloody nasty, those things.

2880:
Sshhh! There's something or someone nearby.

3360:
Ugghh, they have the smell of the dung beetle too.

3840:
Careful here. I have a troubling hunch.

4320:
An ideal habitat for those dung beetles.

4800:
Hell! They're bloody everywhere!

5280:
Over here.

5760:
What's there?

6240:
I have to load more ammo.

6720:
Bloody, hemorrhaging.

8640:
I'm a little foggy! Hope I didn't suffer a minor stroke.

9120:
Bloody cheap firearms.

9600:
My position is under fire!

10080:
Ahhh... Gets the kinks out.

10560:
Afraid they didn't miss by much.

11040:
Not likely.

11520:
A stitch or two might control the bleeding.

12000:
I demand my sleep. It is necessary, you know.

12480:
I lost my breath.

12960:
Return to sender.

13440:
Dung beetle hell for you, bug!

15360:
Mike deserved that! As far as I'm concerned, that bloody American braggart should have been terminated a long time ago.

15840:
Now, I can retire.

16800:
Task completed.

17280:
No! Find another boy.

17760:
I'm always disturbed about killing a lady. Fortunately, that was not the case.

18240:
The bloody carcass couldn't rot away fast enough for me.

18720:
Bloody jackanapes!

19200:
This place is a waste of bloody time and my talent!

19680:
A lot of the mercenaries I am being forced to work with shouldn't be in possession of firearms.

20160:
Watch the sky! They're going to make a run at us.

20640:
This equipment should be donated to some sort of paramilitary charity.

21120:
How does one end up amongst such a classless group of people?

21600:
It's nothing personal, but every race has its place. Something the bloody Americans don't seem to comprehend.

22080:
I knew I could improve.

22560:
Appears highly impractical and stupid!

23040:
No surprise.

25920:
I'm not prepared to rush into anything for the moment.

26400:
Mike? I knew that overconfident ass would find himself in this situation.

26880:
I'm bloody blind.

27360:
This isn't going to work.

27840:
Comes across as a decent chap.

28320:
Hostiles have been detected in this sector.

28800:
Don't let your guard down. The jackanapes could be regrouping.

29760:
It is my weapon of choice.

30240:
That looks like the kid that's driving his mother crazy. Should probably tan his backside before I bring him home.

30720:
Well, she's only a woman, Miguel. We'll all be golfing by the weekend.

31200:
Body bags are the outfit of choice for all enemies in this sector.

31680:
This is completely unacceptable. I demand to know where the rest of the goods are.

32160:
Sure, it disturbs me, but in good conscience, I could not allow this abuse to continue.

32640:
Bloody wildcat!

33120:
Obviously, a handsome dividend for the investment in my time. Perhaps when you think of freedom, you will also think of, "Dr. Clifford Highball."

33600:
They left! We rule the roost.

34080:
I require sleep. I am taking it, and I shall resume work when I wake.

34560:
Back to work.

35040:
Precisely my thoughts.

35520:
Bloody foreign stuff. Can't depend on it for nothing!

36000:
Caution. I have the work of an incompetent here.

36480:
Step careful. We could be stepping on trouble.

36960:
Bloody... hell... Never drink... and swim...

37440:
That little jaunt's over. What now?

38400:
Not bloody likely. Not with a history like yours.

38880:
No, you jackanapes! If I was suicidal, I'd just bloody well hang myself.

39360:
As much as I'd like to, I cannot. My mother-in-law is spending a couple of days with us. I'm afraid I'm destined to spend my time listening to what an ass her last husband was.

39840:
That's too short of a notice. I am afraid I cannot stay.

40320:
Thank you for calling Doctor Clifford Highball. I cannot speak with you at this time. Leave your first name and message, and I will return your call at a more opportune moment.

40800:
Glad I could be of service. You know where to find me if the need arises.

42720:
My contract's nearly complete. Should I assume that your lack of interest is an indication that you will not be renewing?

43200:
Good! This place is beginning to grow on me.

43680:
Done! The next conversation we have will be in Arulco.

45600:
Not in my plans. I'd rather perform an appendectomy on myself!

46080:
Pay attention. I said...

46560:
We are unable to complete this transaction. You need to have the money, jackanapes!

47520:
No, you jackanapes! If I was suicidal, I'd just bloody well hang myself.

50880:
Pay attention. I said...

51360:
We are unable to complete this transaction. You need to have the money, jackanapes!

51840:
Doctor Clifford Highball...

52320:
Few mercenaries have the ability to inflict or relieve pain like I do.

52800:
It really isn't that complicated.

53280:
And you'll be requiring me for how long, precisely?

53760:
There's no need for me to be here if you aren't ready to negotiate.  Have a nice day!

55200:
My contract is almost complete.

55680:
My constant improvement has made me more valuable, hence the rise in my fees.
