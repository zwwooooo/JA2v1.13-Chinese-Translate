Yes.

480:
A returning customer...

960:
The demand for firearms is growing quickly.

1440:
Weapons. They are a good business to be in right now.

1920:
I do not want that.

2400:
I have nothing really to say to you.

2880:
Keep it down. The walls are like cardboard.

3360:
That will not happen. I am very comfortable here in my business.

3840:
A doctor... A doctor soon.

4320:
I am terribly sorry. I do not have any more time.

4800:
Maybe you should show me what you want to buy...

5280:
Point out what it is you are interested in.

5760:
The selection this time of year is excellent.

6240:
It is okay. Take your time.

6720:
You wish to consider a trade, right?

7200:
You are interested in selling, is this correct?

7680:
Hmm. Let me see what we have here...

8160:
I regret I am only interested in weapons and their accessories.

8640:
Worthless...

9120:
It is third market, second market at best. There is only so much I can do.

9600:
There is value to this. I will pay a fair price.

10080:
Unfortunately, it's not enough to buy the things you wanted.

10560:
The deal is done. Anything else?

11040:
All right, there's your purchase and your change.

11520:
Very good. You know where to find me if you are interested in doing more business.

12000:
Perhaps, next time things will be different.

12480:
Excuse me. You are forgetting your stuff.

12960:
No, I cannot afford to buy anything else at the moment.

13440:
You, are a dead bastard!
