Welcome to the Shady Lady. I am Madame Layla, your hostess...

480:
It is with pleasure that I welcome you again.

960:
I'm flattered, but I haven't worked in a long time.

1440:
There's no need to be concerned. Mr. Klaus insists all the girls pass medical examinations. He, himself, personally witnesses these physicals to ensure their thoroughness.

1920:
I only accept cash. Perhaps someone else would be prepared to give you money for it.

2400:
My regrets, but all prices are as stated.

2880:
I try to run a nice, quiet, civil place. I would appreciate your cooperation.

3360:
Do you have any idea how many offers like that the girls and I get each day?

3840:
Oh...ay... I never realized it could hurt this much... I can't recall any of my... eight births being this bad.

4320:
You'll have to excuse me... I need to check on things.

4800:
I always appreciate someone who knows what they want.

5280:
You are not welcome here. Leave now, or deal with the consequences.

5760:
Just you wait until Kingpin hears about this.

6240:
This is a classy place. No more than two men per girl.

6720:
We don't cater to your type of needs, dear. Though there's a woman named Brenda Drake that might be interested. You'll probably find her browsing at the adult store.

7200:
What is it you think you're doing? No one sees my girls without going through me first. You haven't fallen in love have you?

7680:
It's time to leave. My girls need to get some sleep.

8160:
I'm sure you will find something or, rather, someone here that will catch your fancy. My girls were all chosen with creating a wide selection in mind.

8640:
I'm afraid I don't recall who you were interested in last time. Do you have a favorite, or are you looking to expand your horizons?

9120:
Ask her about our full service, full-body massage. It is, by far, our most popular package.

9600:
Carla would be ideal. She's my most experienced. You could visit with her for 100 dollars per person. Naturally, she's not my most youthful girl.

10080:
Very good. You'll find Carla at the end of the hallway in the last room on your left. The door should be open.

10560:
If you were looking for something really special, I have Cindy. She's five hundred per person. But you'd have to promise to be very gentle. We celebrated her eighteenth birthday last night.

11040:
Cindy is in room four. That would be the third door on your right. It should be open.

11520:
May I suggest Bambi for something really different. Mr. Klaus calls her a freak of nature. At 300 dollars apiece, she's someone that you'll be talking about for a long, long time.

12000:
You'll find Bambi waiting for you at the end of the hall, last door on your right.

12480:
Only people who have paid me for a girl's time are allowed back there.

12960:
You know what to do, Billy.

13440:
Maria is one of our newer girls. She's four hundred dollars a head. A little shy, likes to pretend she doesn't like it. Her room is at the end of the hall. You can be forceful if you like. She likes that, too.

13920:
Fine. Oh... and by the way, ignore her screaming if it doesn't do anything for you. It's all part of Maria's role-playing side.

14400:
Can I interest anyone else?

14880:
Didn't I tell you about our no-girl policy? Oh, well. Maybe she won't say anything. It's probably a good time to think about expanding the business anyway.

15360:
That's okay, there will be other occasions. You'll come around. Everyone does.

15840:
I'll need to be paid in advance. That's how we do things around here.

16320:
Have you had a change of heart?

16800:
The two of you may go now.

17280:
I don't understand, or perhaps you didn't. The amount is per customer, and there's a two client maximum per girl.

17760:
All my girls are busy right now. You can come back later, or you can wait if you like. Probably just be a couple minutes. Most men don't take very long.

18240:
Yes, as a matter of fact, things have quieted down.

18720:
I can't take that. I'm not sure who you want. Let me tell you who's available...

19200:
Carla, I believe, is free. She's a hundred dollars.

19680:
There's Cindy at five hundred dollars.

20160:
There's Bambi, who's simply waiting for someone with three hundred dollars and the need for some loving.

20640:
If two of you would like to split a room, just double up the amount.

21120:
We have Maria, who's not for everyone, but well worth the four hundred dollars if you like the resistant type.

21600:
I'm not having a good day. Somebody kidnapped one of my girls. Poor Maria, I get goosebumps just thinking about what they might be doing to her.

22080:
I'd rather live than deal with you! Take care of this mess first!
