I'm Lynn Darrows, the factory manager.

480:
What do you want this time?

960:
This isn't going anywhere.

1440:
You are only wasting time. Mine included.

1920:
I don't want any of your gifts.

2400:
You should just go back to wherever you came from.

2880:
Okay... I'd like to help you, but I really don't have time for this.

3360:
I care nothing about you, or this country.

3840:
Ohhh...the pain. The pain is unbearable!

4320:
I really don't have time for this.

4800:
I hope you're not expecting me to do anything for it... Because I won't.

5280:
This is a private company. You have no business being here.

5760:
I don't understand your concern about the workers.

6240:
You should just go back to wherever you came from.

6720:
You'll find nothing that concerns you, or your war.

7200:
Look! I've had enough of this. I have a business to run. And I'll run it any damn way I choose. You don't like it, too bad.

7680:
You're right! You are absolutely right... I'll shut the factory down.

8160:
I never liked this job anyway. I never liked that woman either.

8640:
I've seen the light. I don't know what I was thinking before, but you straightened me out, and I'm grateful for it.

9120:
You idiot!

9600:
Get away from me. I don't want your help.

10080:
This company will deal with you soon enough, so enjoy life while you can.

10560:
Not now... You're a walking target, in case you hadn't noticed.
