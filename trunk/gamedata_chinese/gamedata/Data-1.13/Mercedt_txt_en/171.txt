0:
Enemies in the vicinity!

480:
OK, let's go!

960:
Scheisse!

1440:
Too much biology here for my taste.

1920:
I must be in the wrong time at the wrong place here...can you all see that thing too?

2400:
I hope this is not a preview of our future?

2880:
Ssh, I heard something.

3360:
It stinks here like in my father's animal food factory! Wonder if we could put them in tins as pet food?

3840:
It is much too quiet here...something is wrong...

4320:
I am never avoiding a fight, it is my second nature... but this here, it is like a big game safari...one of these damn things could pop up to me around the next corner!

4800:
From where the hell are all these animals coming?

5280:
Ah, something useful..

5760:
What is that there?

6240:
I have to reload....but with what?

6720:
I am.... hit hard..but I am also liking life ...would be nice if somebody  is coming to help me...

7200:
Lennart! Schei?e... Us Estonians have to stick together. Aah! It will not be the same without you...

8160:
That is indeed a shame. I mean, she was an American, but..somehow a little more Italian, if you know what I mean...

8640:
Scheisse...is it time for...oh..eh?

9120:
My gun is jamming!

9600:
They want me...very much.

10080:
That was very rough.

10560:
Hah,just missed...you will not get me so easy like that!

11040:
Even a sniper could not hit anything here...oh, am I a sniper now too?

11520:
Hey, that is my blood...MY God...is that MY blood I am seeing here?

12000:
When it is time to sleep, you should sleep...there is a time for fighting and a time for dreaming.

12480:
Just breathe, Janno.

12960:
One more gone.

13440:
Like I am saying ...big game safari.

13920:
That Sidney...he will soon have a unmoving upper lip...do you wish to bet on this?

14880:
If I must listen to this Reaper much longer, I will be a bad mental case. He really is getting me down...

15360:
I got Mike...ja, good feeling.

15840:
Maybe I should have followed in the footsteps of my father... Canning animal food is a nice, quiet job.

16320:
Good to have a big blaster like this.

16800:
Ja, all done!

17280:
No, that will not do.

17760:
Ach, she probably could not cook either.

18240:
 - So...that was it - the monster mama.

18720:
You know the kind that are not appreciating a good meal? Annoying , very annoying.

19200:
Somehow this is all just so...scheisse.

19680:
I do not like any of this. The country, the people, ...and mainly the dummies all around me...

20160:
Air attack!

20640:
Scrap...it is all scrap!

21120:
The people need much more training and they must be willing to LEARN.

21600:
I could pick an English face out of a thousand different ones.

22080:
Slowly but surely, I am getting better.

22560:
That plan - it is somehow ..not good.

23040:
Hmm. That was to be expected.

23520:
So now I have to listen to this Schweinehund Sidney the whole time? If I had known that, I would not have been here.

24480:
Jaaa, Lennart! I just knew I would like to work together with you.

25440:
I like her. American women are usually...well...But with Grace?.. You can know right away her Italian blood - and they know their food too.

25920:
What do you say we wait a while - just to see how things go...

26400:
Nein...Mike?

26880:
My eyes are on fire...dark...nein..NEIN..I can't see..!

27360:
Nobody in the world could do this.

27840:
Friendly people here.

28320:
This sector is occupied...by the enemy...time to change that.

28800:
Attention! I think we have not got them all.

29280:
What is that?

29760:
My weapon always speaks the last word!

30240:
Hey, looks like Joey...the one we are looking for!

30720:
I am pleased to be here, Miguel.

31200:
I think we have killed them all.

31680:
Is something not missing?

32160:
She deserved that.

32640:
A big cat..I don't believe it.

33120:
We can say it now...it was really like a...'mission impossible'. But...we did it!

33600:
All gone? Hmm, they have retreated, I think...

34080:
I must sleep...eating and sleeping must not be neglected.

34560:
Ready for duty.

35040:
Me too.

35520:
I could do it ok if this thing would work...but it's kaputt.

36000:
Looks like explosive to me.

36480:
Attention...it could be a trap down there.

36960:
I'm...going down..!

37440:
I am here now - I await your orders.

38400:
Your reputation is not the best...people talk about it.

38880:
I am a merc because I choose it...but this does not mean that I love death...

39360:
I must complete my tax forms...I have no time.

39840:
I have a date...sorry. You see, I did not know until now...I mean, that you wished to extend my contract...next time, tell me much sooner...

40320:
Here Janno Allik. If you are having important news for me, please speak now

40800:
Ok, we are all done here...much luck for the future.

41280:
Better you look for a different merc. One who likes to work with SCHEISS Engl?nder!

42240:
I need a change...when I hear Reaper, I get cold and hot. The world gets dark around my head...

42720:
I should like to work more for you...if you wish this too?

43200:
Gut. You should be happy with my results too.

43680:
Very good...I shall join you.

44160:
Together with Lennart? I will go through scheisse, I will even eat it too... you understand?

45120:
Something is telling me no, but when you have Grace Girelli...I am with you.

45600:
After the last mission? I would not walk with you even to a snack bar!

46080:
I said...

46560:
Money is everything. A stupid saying, but in your case, it is fitting. You have not enough money.

47040:
You are having a problem, hmm? I will leave now.

47520:
You have perhaps made a bet how many mercs you lose on a mission? Nein, nein...not with me.

48000:
When I am looking long enough at Sidney, I feel my own upper lip going stiff.

48960:
If I have to work longer with Reaper, I shall myself become a member of the Dark Forces of Evil...nein, thank you.

49440:
My friend Lennart and I are an unbeatable team...that is why I shall ignore  my feelings and I shall say Yes.

50400:
With Grace Girelli? I would wander through Arulco with pleasure... otherwise, I do not believe so.

50880:
I said...

51360:
You have not enough money. You have perhaps not been noticing this?

51840:
Hello...

52320:
I would now like a steak with big potatoes and gravy, hah!

52800:
I should have taken my camera with me...for some nice photos, you understand?

53280:
For how long do you want me to be working for you?

53760:
I am cooking and my onions are burning black - when you have a good plan please call me back - only then will I stop cooking.

54240:
I do not want to work with Sidney...I am having an allergy against his kind ..nein.

55200:
I just want to tell you that my contract is ending soon.

55680:
I am better now - I think more money would be fair for me, hmmm?
