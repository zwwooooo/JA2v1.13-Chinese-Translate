I found one!

480:
I've come across one.

960:
I have a couple to deal with.

1440:
I found one!

1920:
I think... I may have left the lights on at my place. I... gotta leave...

2400:
Body was subjected to indignities beyond belief!

2880:
I could've done without that.

3360:
I don't like the looks of it.

3840:
This area is dangerous. Let's be very careful where we walk.

4320:
This area is dangerous. Let's be very careful where we walk.

4800:
I have a couple to deal with.

5280:
I see something here.

5760:
I see something.

6240:
I could use some lead!

6720:
Severely wounded... Doubt I can remain conscious for long. Send help... immediately!

8640:
I flat out forgot where I was headed.

9120:
My weapon isn't firing!

9600:
The bullets are flying in all directions over here!

10080:
I'm gonna have to give up the smokes, my lungs are shut.

10560:
Oh. By a whisker...

11040:
I can't hit what I can't see!

11520:
I'll need a moment to dress my wounds, before I lose too much blood.

12000:
I could probably sneak a smoke.

12480:
Doubt I can remain conscious for long.

12960:
Death took a holiday - and it's vacationing with you!

13440:
Let's try this again.

13920:
If you still have that madman, "Unusually Ruthless" Reuban, on your team in the morning, I won't be here!

15360:
That went rather smoothly.

15840:
Word is - you're the one responsible for the medical kit shortage!

16800:
Our work is done.

17280:
You're making this hard for me, but... I can't. I won't do that.

17760:
Assignments don't get much better than this!

18240:
It's done! The smokes are on me!

18720:
So, when was the last time you had a thorough physical?

19200:
You bring back bad memories of the time I worked the night shift in E.R. in the Bronx. Too much unnecessary death forced me to leave there too.

19680:
This outfit doesn't care if it ever wins a mission.

20160:
I could've done without that.

20640:
I'm trying - but this thing doesn't work!

21120:
How you've been feeling lately? Any complaints about your health, that might require further investigation?

21600:
I don't wish to brag or anything, but I'd like to point out that I'm the official A.I.M. physician.

22080:
It only gets easier.

22560:
And you have the nerve to call yourself a professional?

23040:
We can give up on this mission.

23520:
If there's anyone who deserves to be put down - it's Reuban...  As long as he's working for you - I'm not.

25920:
Health care reform never happened! You're gonna have to find the cash, if you want me to so much as put a band-aid on anyone. And this time around, there will be no attempt to bargaining away the problem.

26400:
Loyalty doesn't exist in your vocabulary, does it?

26880:
Come on!

27360:
It's more complicated than it looks!

27840:
I go both ways...

28320:
Alright! I'm putting on the gloves!

28800:
You won't live much longer!

29280:
Just what we've been looking for.

30240:
Just what we've been looking for.

30720:
I'm shocked! You're firing me this quickly?

31200:
I can't tell ya, how glad I am not to be responsible for treating YOUR wounded! 

31680:
I'm no expert, but I think we paid way too much for the stuff.

32160:
Well, I've ran out of patience.

32640:
I found one!

33120:
It goes to show you. The good guys do win once in a while! I'd work for you again, if the need arose.

33600:
We shouldn't be seeing any more of those clowns.

34080:
You can expect me shortly.

34560:
Consider me committed to your cause.

35040:
How many times do I have to tell you?

35520:
This thing doesn't work!

36000:
I don't like the looks of it.

36480:
If we're not careful over here, it could be dangerous.

36960:
I'm drowning!..

37440:
For the moment - we are out in front.
