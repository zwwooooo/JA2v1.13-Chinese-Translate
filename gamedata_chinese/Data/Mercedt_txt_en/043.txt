Dead meat!

480:
Thanksgiving's here... time to carve some turkeys!

960:
I've got one beautiful mess here!

1440:
Here, kitty kitty!

1920:
Yeeeha. Y'ever pull a cat inside-out by its tail? Well, right there is what she looks like when yer done. Only the cat's smaller, y'know?

2400:
One o' them been draggin' its ass through here.

2880:
I heard something unfriendly-sounding.

3360:
Mmm, something smells good...

3840:
Y'know that weird feeling ya get when yer guts slide around in yer belly? I got that feelin' now. It uh, means...uh, danger.

4320:
Might get lucky and get to kill myself one of them ugly things.

4800:
Ain't never had so much fun in my life.

5280:
What's that there?

5760:
What's that?

6240:
Damn guns. A knife never runs out of ammo.

6720:
Woo-eeya, I'm finally gettin' to see my own innards. Just wish I could see them clearly.

7200:
Haywire! Get up, you asshole! I seen you get hurt worse than that and walk away...okay, anything for a joke, that's you.

8160:
Hah! Fidel, Fidel, Fidel! I bet you you were gonna get killed before me, and you did! Pay up! Where's my $200? C'mon, pay up, man! Fidel? Hey, wait a minute...you gypped me! Aw, man, I shoulda died first!

8640:
I was just gonna do somethin'. Damned if I can remember what.

9120:
My gun's jammed! This is why knives are SO much better.

9600:
Ooh, those turkeys're gettin' FEISTY! Gobble gobble gobble!

10080:
Not a scratch. Good thing I've got calluses over 90 per cent of my body.

10560:
Shoulda done the job. 'Cause now you're gonna die.

11040:
Probably miss that target from here. Maybe I should just knife 'em.

11520:
Hey, blood's pourin' outta me faster than I can lick it up!

12000:
I wanna sleep. Not the big sleep, y'know, just a small one.

12480:
One of these days, I'm gettin' myself a third lung.

12960:
Bought it!

13440:
Couple hundred pounds of cat food!

13920:
Wimpy and screeching and afraid of her own shadow. That's Flo. What a waste of skin!

14880:
Y'know what I'd like? To carve up Biff. He may be the boss, but he's completely useless. At least we'd have some decent food for a change.

15360:
Okay, that's it. I've had it. Biff's a pussy. You can't depend on anyone who doesn't enjoy killing! So what the hell good is he? I'm leavin'!

15840:
That's the quick way to lose 10 pounds!

16320:
I don't know why everybody thinks I'm psychotic! I'm NOT psychotic, I just have passion for my job!

16800:
Okay, all done.

17280:
I don't want to do that. And you don't want to try to make me.

17760:
How do you think she'd look stuffed and mounted?

18240:
Let's celebrate! I'm thinking of fillin' a few glasses with pus and makin' a toast.

18720:
I'm gettin' sick of that yellowbelly. Prob'ly doesn't even know how to skin a baby.

19200:
This ain't no fun at all.

19680:
What a bunch of sissy bleedin' hearts. And I don't mean that in a nice way.

20160:
Incoming bombers!

20640:
Cheap guns, dull knives, flimsy helmets... it's enough to make me stab myself.

21120:
Can't think of a better job--blood, lust and a steady paycheck.

21600:
If the Arulcans can't defend their own country, they don't DESERVE their own country. We oughta take it over and kick 'em all the hell out.

22080:
Ya got it, or you don't.

22560:
I got a sickly feelin' about this....

23040:
That was dumber than pancreas.

23520:
I've had it up to here with Flo, runnin' around shriekin' like a chicken with her head cut off every time there's trouble. You hired her, you take care of her. I'm passin' on the whole deal. Later.

24480:
That's Haywire. One-hundred-and-seventy pounds of raw fun. Hah!

25440:
Fidel knows what's what.

25920:
Speck tells me you're sorta behind on your payments. Now I could take it outta your skin, but I'm just gonna leave you here without me. Maybe the locals'll take care of things for me.

26880:
Thing pissed right in my eyes. It's damn lucky I can't see it!

27360:
Maybe somebody else has got the patience. 'Cause I don't!

27840:
Ah... I'll let him live.

28320:
Got enemies in the area. Good.

28800:
I say we hunt them down to the last man and slit his throat. I hate loose ends.

29280:
It's all right, I guess. Woulda liked one of 'em new, high-tech, fancy  blades though.

30240:
That runaway kid. You know, if I cut the main tendon in his heel, his mom will never have to look for him again.

30720:
Man, and I was just getting into this, too. Like, I had visions of Ginsu dancing in my head.

31200:
They're all done? That was quick.

31680:
Something's wrong here. It's like cutting up medical school leftovers. You open the body, but stuff's already missing.

32160:
Would anybody get offended if I took her ear?

32640:
Come to papa...

33120:
I just want to do a quick count here. Who's up for getting our asses over to a neighboring country and starting up something?

33600:
Ah, the pansyasses ran away to warn their friends! Good. They'll all be freakin' nervous by the time we get there.

34080:
Feeling zapped. Think I'll pass out for a bit.

34560:
I'm back, sharp and ready to hit the cutting board.

35040:
Include me.

35520:
This thing's useless.

36000:
We ain't the first person to handle this, and if I ain't careful, I could be the last.

36480:
Hey... what's up with the ground around here?

36960:
I'm sinking... like a freakin... rock.

37440:
I got to where you wanted me to go. Better be plenty of stuff to shoot at.
