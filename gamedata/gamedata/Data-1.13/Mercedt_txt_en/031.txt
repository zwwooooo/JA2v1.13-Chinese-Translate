Squaddie.

480:
Break's over!

960:
Time to get tough.

1440:
Prehistoric ant!

1920:
Bloody Creepers! Reminds me of me ex-wife's lawyer.

2400:
They sure keep themselves busy.

2880:
Heard a strange noise.

3360:
<sniff Man-o-man! Got some prehistoric gas comin' out of 'em.

3840:
Should tread carefully around here.

4320:
Wish they'd just show their ugly heads so we could get this started.

4800:
If I could find their neck, I'd snap it!

5280:
There's something.

5760:
Could be of use.

6240:
More lead'd be good.

6720:
I'm passed saving. Ugh... Let me die. At least I know my ex-wives will have to find work.

7200:
If they can get Mike... Anyone of us could be next!

8640:
Feeling tuned out. What's up again?

9120:
My piece crapped out.

9600:
They got me in their sights.

10080:
One of these days, it's a new line of work for me.

10560:
Good try, cadet!

11040:
Hardly anything to get a fix on!

11520:
I'm bleedin' steady.

12000:
<yawn It's time to talk to the sandman.

12480:
Chest's... crampin'.

12960:
Hope it hurt!

13440:
Gotcha!

13920:
Kaboom's a menace. I don't know how many times he's nearly blown me up. I'll be sure not to miss!

15360:
He was my best friend.

15840:
Doubt I'll find an ear to collect...

16800:
I'm free.

17280:
Not bloody likely.

17760:
Usually, I'm attracted to a woman like that... maybe I've finally gotten over it.

18240:
Thank God! The next job with bugs I pass on.

18720:
Bet mom was a prostitute and dad stiffed her.

19200:
What was I thinking when I signed on?

19680:
I'm working with a good bunch of mates.

20160:
Take cover, mates.

20640:
The stuff I've been getting to use is decaying. It was probably poorly stored somewhere for years.

21120:
It's good to get away once in awhile and meet some new mates.

21600:
La-di-da twits can take their manners and nose-in-the-air attitude and stick it up their starched white shirt-tails.

22080:
I get off on it.

22560:
Was it a late night, mate?

23040:
Reality bites, doesn't it?

23520:
Stand back! It looks like Marty Moffat.

24480:
Mike's top dog!

25920:
Hang on to that thought, mate.

26400:
Ah, please... let it not be Mike.

26880:
Got some of the bloody bug juice right in me eyes. Now...I can't see f-all!

27360:
Did what I could.

27840:
Someone I'd split a pint with.

28320:
It's an unfriendly sector, mate.

28800:
Still got unfriendlies hidin' somewhere, mate.

29760:
Firepower, mate! Separates the men from the boys!

30240:
It's that urchin Graham. We should bag him and send him home to his mum.

30720:
She won't get far with that, seeing that we're here. Have confidence, Miguel. She'll be the one with the worries now.

31200:
Squad down! Better luck next time!

31680:
I don't want to point any fingers, mate, but someone's had their hand in the cookie jar.

32160:
She reminded me of my second wife. My fourth and fifth, too. If you get my drift, this was a right good thing we'd done here. Haven't got the time or money to put 'em all through therapy.

32640:
Zoo's out, mate!

33120:
Sure, there were ups and downs, but all in all, it was a great job. Good to be a part, mate.

33600:
Look at that, will ya? They put their tails in their arse and ran away.

34080:
I'll just get me a bit of slumber, and I'll be right better at this.

34560:
Catnap does the trick. I'm back at her, mate.

35040:
My thoughts exactly.

35520:
Damn. Perhaps I should have looked after this more carefully.

36000:
This bugger's set to blow.

36480:
Looks like they've laid out a welcome mat for us.

36960:
Don't let my body... stay in the water for...long. Don't want any of me eight kids... to see my bloated body.

37440:
Had a good trek, mate. What ya be looking for me to do now?

38400:
Word's filtered back, mate. You ain't the type of boss I'm looking for. Maybe some of the new, more desperate guys can help you out.

38880:
Not bloody likely. You've built up quite a collection of rotting corpses, mate. I've got eight kids to think of, and none of their moms work.

39360:
I can't commit to anything right now, mate. Waitin' on a call back from another war that's about to explode.

39840:
Sorry, mate, but while you were deciding what you wanted to do with me, I signed on for something else.

40320:
You've reached the home of Robert James Sullivan. If you're calling about hiring one of the best mercenaries in the business, leave a message.

40800:
It's quite the country, mate. Glad I could be of help.

41280:
Kaboom needs help tying his freakin' shoes. And you actually expect me to work with him? You must be crazier than he is!

42720:
Tick-tock, tick-tock... You got some decisions to make, mate. I can't hang around without a contract.

43200:
All right, mate. It's back to business.

43680:
Sure... I could use some time away from here.

44160:
Just so you're up to speed. If it wasn't for Mike being on your team, I wouldn't be joining.

45600:
Not bloody likely, mate. I'd rather have root canals done on all of me teeth.

46080:
No problem, mate. I said...

46560:
Tough luck. Would have liked to help you out, but I got to get paid, mate.

47040:
I was kinda hoping to spend a little more time down here, but you're in charge, mate.

47520:
Not bloody likely. You've built up quite a collection of rotting corpses, mate. I've got eight kids to think of, and none of their moms work.

48000:
Everything was cool until you went and hired Kaboom. I can't stay on with you as long as he's on your team. He's got soup for brains... He needs help using a fork!

49440:
Just so you're up to speed. If it wasn't for Mike being on your team, I wouldn't be joining.

50880:
No problem, mate. I said...

51360:
Tough luck. Would have liked to help you out, but I got to get paid, mate.

51840:
Robert James Sullivan is not here at the moment... oh, sorry, mate... I thought it was someone else. Scully here.

52320:
I ask one thing, mate. Don't let my problems with women get you questioning my loyalty, because THAT you can bank on. I'm just a really... sociable guy.

52800:
I got a bit of time, mate.

53280:
Surely, mate, you'll want to consider the massive savings on a steady gig.

53760:
I don't have this much time, mate. Nobody does! Gotta go.

54240:
Allow me to give you a tip. You never want to be anywhere near Kaboom when he's cleaning his gun.

55200:
Clock's moving, mate. This gig's coming to a close.

55680:
Ching-ching! Hey, mate, I reckon that someone with my talent deserves a bit of a raise. Not that I'll actually see any of it, mind you, not with the child support payments I've got to make.
