'Ello, gov'nor. Name's Paul MacCartney. Yeah, just like the Beatle.

480:
'Ello,gov'nor. Fancy meeting you again.

960:
Yeah, the Beatles were a real togetha group... Until they broke up.

1440:
Are you daft? Ringo was the drummer.

1920:
No thanks, gov'nor. I only collect Beatles LPs.

Fisticuffs! No way gov'nor, count me out.

3360:
However appealing the offer might be, I'm just a fan, not a player.

3840:
Bloody Hell gov'nor! Get me to the nurse on time.

4320:
Well, take care gov'nor. Got me a line on an original pressing of 'Rubber Soul'. Catch you on the Flip Side.

4800:
Bloddy hell, get away from me! They're shootin' at you!

5280:
Oh, your lookin' for Blair aren't you?  Yeah, I saw him. The constable had him. I think they said they were takin' him over to Sheraton.
