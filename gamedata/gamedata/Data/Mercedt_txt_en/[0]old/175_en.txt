0:
We have enemy contact.

480:
The operation can begin!

960:
I need some help here.

1440:
Interesting creatures!

1920:
Pity my father isn't here. This species would interest him indeed.

2400:
Carnivores, maybe even omnivores? I could not say.

2880:
I heard something.

3360:
Could this be pheromone? This stuff is not meant for humans to smell.

3840:
It is much too peaceful here.

4320:
My interest in this new species is somewhat limited! I do not wish to study their hunting behavior from close-up.

4800:
Oh, they hunt in packs...aah!

5280:
A closer look at that...

5760:
What is that?

6240:
Out of ammo!

6720:
I need a pressure bandage - and morphium - fast!

7200:
Rudolf... it had to happen. It was either you or me... It is out of our hands. But really, could you EVER have imagined us two in a fireplace rocking chair?

7680:
Pity about you, Victor. You were a man of principle. That impressed me.

8160:


8640:
Where were we?

9120:
This weapon is jamming.

9600:
Too much lead in the air!

10080:
That was bad...

10560:
That was very close.

11040:
Wishful thinking.

11520:
I'm losing too much blood. I have to stop this bleeding!

12000:
Human bodies need a pause - it is time for mine.

12480:
It's like a rarified atmosphere - breathe...breathe!

12960:
He definitely earned that.

13440:
Maybe I should take a bio-sample?

13920:
That Buzz really gets to me.

14400:


14880:
Fox is exactly the right name for that little tramp.

15360:
It's over, Mike.

15840:
No doctor can help here.

16320:


16800:
I await new orders.

17280:
Regretfully, I have to say no.

17760:
Operation concluded - patient dead.

18240:
It's a shame really. And I have no formaldehyde... Do we have any dry ice here?

18720:
It would be better for some team members to get out of my way....fast.

19200:
My motivation is at zero level. This mission has lost its meaning for me.

19680:
Some people don't belong here - or, I could be in the wrong place at the wrong time - but mostly in the wrong company.

20160:
Air strike!

20640:
As a doctor I like to have good tools when I'm stitching someone up - as a merc, when I am killing someone, I do not need Scheisse like this!

21120:


21600:


22080:
It's nice when one can master something - and I am getting better all the time...

22560:
Doubtful...very doubtful.

23040:
Well, just as I said...

23520:
That Buzz has a bad effect on my circulation.

24000:


24480:
There is no one better than Rudolf!

24960:
Yes! Excellent, Victor! Why do they all call you Monk?

25440:


25920:
Too soon for me...let us wait to see how it will be.

26400:
Mike?

26880:
Ahh, my retina, my EYES...I can see nothing!

27360:
Surgical and military operations have one thing in common - some simply cannot be done...

27840:
One must admire the people here for their endurance. I can well imagine what they have been through.

28320:
Enemy in vicinity!

28800:
We are not done here yet - there are still enemies around.

29280:
What is that?

29760:
An excellent weapon!

30240:
That must be Joey - after him!

30720:
My apologies for my countrywoman. It is a special pleasure for me to help this country and its people. I have known the horrors of a dictatorship too.

31200:
This sector is now green - and surgically clean.

31680:
There are items missing. Someone has helped himself to our supplies.

32160:
It is through people like her that evil governments can exist and flourish.

32640:
Arulco really has very interesting fauna...

33120:
It is a good feeling, this fighting for a better world. I liken it to the feeling I get after a clean, successful operation. You first remove a cancerous growth - then the patient has rehabilitation...mmm-mmh

33600:
It would seem that the enemy has retreated.

34080:
I will sleep now.

34560:
Ahh, that was good. Even a short sleep can work wonders for the body.

35040:
My opinion exactly.

35520:
This thing here is kaputt.

36000:
Looks like a booby trap.

36480:
Be careful to watch the ground - it is perhaps a trap.

36960:
I am drowning...!

37440:
I await new orders.

37920:


38400:
No thank you. I have been reading about you - and the conditions in which people have to be working under you.

38880:
Corpses surround you - you are well-known for this.

39360:
I must visit a medical congress, I am sorry.

39840:
I do not like it when one makes me wait. The next time you could ask earlier...

40320:
Here is Dr. Laura Colin. In urgent cases, please buzz my pager.

40800:
You may ask me again next time...

41280:
I do not like being bugged. And Buzz bugs me very much - no, I am sorry.

41760:


42240:
No, not if our 'little fox' is on the team - that one I hate...she annoys me very badly.

42720:
Would you agree to a contract extension, perhaps?

43200:
Good. We agree.

43680:
Yes, I believe the mission will hold much interest for me.

44160:
I may speak openly...the reason why I am accepting in spite of my... misgivings.. is that you have employed Rudof Steiger. He is a true professional - if he is with us, my concerns are nothing.

44640:
Well, I am curious to know whether my positive impression of this Victor Kolesnikov can be true - therefore.. I agree.

45120:


45600:
Hah! I could imagine something much better...a better atmosphere, do you understand? Like going to the dentist to get a tooth pulled...

46080:
I said...

46560:
If you have money problems, please do not ask rhetorical questions in future, OK?

47040:
It is your decision.

47520:
I am of the opinion that too many good people die on your missions. And I do not mean through illness either!

48000:
I cannot stand men-hating women like that Buzz - I must say no.

48480:


48960:
With Fox together? Thank you, no. If I wish to hear telephone sex during a mission, I will let you know.

49440:
I like to work with Rudolf. For me he is a full pro. However, I must tell you...this is the only reason why I am saying yes.

49920:
That Victor Kolesnikov interests me, indeed...of course on a purely professional basis...I say yes!

50400:


50880:
I said...

51360:
You have no capital...but perhaps you are not aware of this?

51840:
Hallo?

52320:
Perhaps we should make a few...stretches and pushups?

52800:
More speed would be appreciated.

53280:
The contract...how long were you thinking of?

53760:
When you know what you wish - call me. I ask you not to be so generous in future - with my time.

54240:
I prefer not to work with Buzz. She has an effect on every team like arsenic on a human stomach.

54720:


55200:
Please remember - our agreement is coming to an end.

55680:
I am getting better and better. I think my pay should reflect this fact.
