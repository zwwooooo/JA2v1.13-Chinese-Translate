How do? Franz Hinkle. Purveyor of the finest electronics and other goods!

480:
Ja, gut to see you again.

960:
Fascinating what they're doing with wireless these days, no?

1440:
Something I can help you with?

1920:
Danke, but I have no use for that.

2400:
All right then. What do you need?

2880:
I look excitable to you, ja? I get upset, I cross wires. It's no good for anyone.

3360:
I don't think so. I get all the action I can handle in other ways.

3840:
I think... I should see a doctor.

4320:
You come see me if you need me.

4800:
There's something you want to buy, ja?

5280:
Everything's right there. Let me know what interests you.

5760:
Ja, I have quite a bit to offer, no?

6240:
I tried one of those "Don't pay a cent event" sales, but the first five customers were shot dead before they paid a cent. It's unpredictable here. Now, I take my money at time of purchase.

6720:
Maybe we can work out a deal for this, no?

7200:
Something you'd like to sell, ja?

7680:
All right, then. Just give me a minute.

8160:
Hm. No, I am only interested in certain things, ja?

8640:
Worth nothing! Maybe sell it to an Aussie, ja? They like junk.

9120:
Hm. This has seen better days, ja? Cannot give you much.

9600:
This looks good. I'll make you fine deal.

10080:
Let's see, no, no. There's not enough here for what you want to purchase.

10560:
Great! Business is booming. I knew it would pick up.

11040:
Good! And here's your change.

11520:
You keep me in mind in the future. Remember Franz Hinkle's finest electronics and other goods. Has a ring to it, ja?

12000:
Another time, maybe.

12480:
Leaving this here?

12960:
No offense, but I can't buy anymore right now. I been saving for an omni-directional antenna. Maybe when business picks up, ja?

13440:
You have more nerve than common sense!

13920:
I feel okay now, ja.

14400:
When the shooting stops, you come see me.

14880:
The war goes good for you, ja? I am glad to hear this.

15360:
Things are tough for you now, ja? Franz cannot pick sides. You try harder. Everybody's a customer.

15840:
Well, look at the time, ja? I need to flip the sign to the "closed" side, if you know what I mean.
