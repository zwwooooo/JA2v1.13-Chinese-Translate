I'm extremely busy here - ridding the world of sinners!

1440:
I've encountered evil!

1920:
I've encountered evil, ignorant of my existence.

2400:
Oh my Lord! This is not a good sign.

2880:
A definite indication something isn't right, my brother.

3360:
Repent and be saved, my dear brother!

3840:
This house of evil shall fall, let's move quickly!

4320:
Oh my Lord - if it isn't the Devil himself!

4800:
They're congregating!

5280:
I've spotted something!

5760:
I've spotted something!

6240:
I do miracles, not magic! I need more ammunition, now!

6720:
Forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those th...

8640:
I seem to have lost my way.

9120:
This gun won't fire!

9600:
How's about some respect for the cloth?

10080:
I need a breather.

10560:
Praise be to God!

11040:
It would take a miracle!

11520:
I'm wounded.

12000:
Let's call it a day.

12480:
I need a breather.

12960:
May you be judged with mercy.

13440:
It bothers me to think that I laid witness to such heresy.

13920:
"Unusually Ruthless" Reuban is living proof that the Lord naps. Rid yourself of Satan and I'll continue to work for you.

15360:
Sorry, but as the good book sayeth - thou shall not stiff thy fellow mercenary.

15840:
Beg for forgiveness, and perhaps thou shall be forgiven!

16320:
Oh my Lord.

16800:
We have brought this mission to its rightful conclusion, my dear brother.

17280:
You must be confused.

17760:
Satan waits patiently for your arrival!

18240:
Victory's assured with God on your side!

18720:
Are you not familiar with the Old Testament?

19200:
My patience has been worn miraculously thin, my brother.

19680:
The world wasn't built in a day, my dear brother.

20160:
Repent and be saved, my dear brother!

20640:
It would take a miracle to get this thing working.

21120:
I imagine you'll expect me to provide religious services. Of course, after the service, I'll be available to waste whomever you want.

21600:
I'll expect you to attend my service every morning at seven.

22080:
I was blessed very early in life.

22560:
The Devil has had his say. We shall not be able to fulfill our objective.

23040:
My dear, dear brother! You were guided by misfortune. You have failed with such consistency, that I doubt you shall ever see the light!

23520:
Reuban T. Satan is by far the worst piece of work Lucifer has ever sent to represent him on God's Earth! I won't work with him.

25920:
I must quit, my brother. Though the Lord's work I do for free, I expect to get paid for the services I provide you. I can no longer take that for granted.

26400:
I have heard the man's confession. He makes Judas look like a misguided tattletale.

26880:
The Devil be cursed!

27360:
Surely there must be someone better qualified to do this!

27840:
I'm most grateful to have broken bread with you, my dear brother.

28320:
Prepare to meet thy maker!

28800:
I have seen more action in a chapel.

29760:
Thank the Lord!

30240:
With all due respect - this isn't very christian of you!

30720:
As much as I appreciate all the opportunities to administer last rites, I must be on my way.

31200:
With the help of the good Lord, I believe we've managed to secure this area!

31680:
You transaction has left us holding the short hand, my dear brother.

32160:
You're forgiven.

32640:
I've encountered evil!

33120:
We may not have changed the course of the world, dear brother - but we have made it clear who's in charge!

33600:
There's no need to be concerned with that group anymore.

34080:
Be patient, my dear brother.

34560:
We shall take the journey together, my dear brother.

35040:
As I've mentioned...

35520:
It would take a miracle to get this thing working.

36000:
It's booby trapped! But I've seen better.

36480:
We must watch ourselves. Someone has manipulated the soil.

36960:
I need your help, dear Lord!.. For I have lost a strength to swim any further...

37440:
Forgive me for the delay, my dear brother. I am with you.
