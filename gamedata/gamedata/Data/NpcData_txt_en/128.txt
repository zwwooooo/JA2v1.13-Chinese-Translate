We no meet before... Arnold Brunzwell, Arulco's Blacksmith and Handyman. Whatever the need, I fix it for you in no time. Well, not much time, anyway.

480:
You again, huh? You got work for me, I guess.

960:
Is an old trade, blacksmith. Machines, computers, they no do it right. Take a special hand and eye to get metal into shape.

1440:
I fix anything for you, but I no like electronics. Me and Fredo, we have a pact. He no become a blacksmith, I no fix electronics.

1920:
Interesting, but I no want it.

2400:
Business pick up lately. Arulco's army men blow up everything! Is always something to be fixed. Bad for the country. Good for me.

2880:
Hot one outside, no? Dis weather, it make people go crazy! Hunh?

3360:
No, hot metal belongs in a forge, not in me. I no want to die.

3840:
I suffer, terribly...

4320:
I get back to work now.

4800:
Maybe you tell me first what you need fixed.

5280:
You relax, man. Let me know what I can do for you. I get it done fast, fast, fast. Anything but electronics... get it back to you in about half an hour.

5760:
I'm thinking, maybe someday, I do the half-hour guarantee, like a pizza place, no? Half-hour for your repair or it's free. Then again, maybe I wait 'til the war is over.

6240:
Speed and efficiency, they be my mottos.

7200:
Something you need fixed, man?

7680:
All right, then. Let me have a look at what you got.

8160:
No, man. Not electronics. I told you, Fredo and I have a deal. You take the wirey stuff to him to fix. He in Grumm.

8640:
Ah, dis looks fine! No need to fix it.

9120:
Oh, I don't know if I could fix dis! I give it a try. Mean extra work for me, so I charge you a bit more.

9600:
Yeah, dis stuff? I fix it for you, man. Won't take no time.

10080:
Is not enough to cover charges here.

10560:
Yeah, we done then. I appreciate it. Thank you.

11040:
Thank you, and no forget your change. Is pleasure to deal with the good side.

11520:
I do best to have it ready for you, as soon as I can.

12000:
Maybe next time you find something you need.

12480:
Think you forgot something here.

12960:
Hey, man. There's only one of me.  You leave some now, and then some more later.

13440:
You a crazy dog!

13920:
I closed 'til the shooting stop.

14400:
It's too dangerous to talk to you. You're not liked in Grumm. People will talk.

14880:
You're a hero around here. It will be joy to serve you.

15360:
Better now... I better now.

15840:
Hey, I say quick service, not magic! I want to do good job! You come  back in a bit, and maybe it be ready.

16320:
I be closing up now, so if you don't mind, it's time for you to go. You can come back tomorrow, if you like.
