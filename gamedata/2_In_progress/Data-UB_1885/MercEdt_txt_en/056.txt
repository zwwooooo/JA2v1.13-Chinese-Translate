0:
More scum!

480:
Okay, let's pop some zits.

960:
Got my butt in a sling here!

1440:
Boogiebug in the vicinity.

1920:
God, I used to think somethin' like that lived underneath my bed. We called it, "the boogieman."

2400:
Lookit this mess. Must've been left by one of them boogiebugs.

2880:
I heard a funny noise.

3360:
Christ-mas, that's foul.

3840:
Gettin' goosebumps. Usually happens before all hell breaks loose.

4320:
Gotta keep an eye out for those boogiebugs.

4800:
The boogies are nailin' me!

5280:
Check that.

5760:
Someone dropped something.

6240:
This baby needs ammunition.

6720:
I ain't dead yet, but that's about the only good news I got.

8640:
Gimme that again. I got turned around a bit.

9120:
This gun picked a fine time to jam up.

9600:
Good time for a grenade.

10080:
Aah, playground stuff.

10560:
Good thing I ain't afraid to die.

11040:
That shot don't look good from here.

11520:
I got a rare blood type, so I better stop bleedin' soon.

12000:
I'm ready to drop. I should catch a few winks.

12480:
Need a minute...to get my breath back.

12960:
Ashes to ashes!

13440:
Back to hell.

15840:
Euh, takes a helluva lot to make me puke, but that's just about my limit.

16800:
Squared away. Find me somethin' else.

17280:
I don't feel much like it.

17760:
Wasn't nothin'. Though, I'd love to do it again.

18240:
Yee-haw! That sure beat steppin' on it.

18720:
What a wampass.

19200:
I'd rather be sellin' cookies door-to-door than puttin' up with this crap.

19680:
I dunno what rock these guys crawled out from under, but most of 'em creep me out.

20160:
The bastards're flyin' in low!

20640:
This equipment and a buck wouldn't get ya a cup of coffee.

22080:
I'm gettin' the knack.

22560:
And where's the brains of this outfit?

23040:
What the hell did we THINK was gonna happen? A miracle?

26400:
The place looks deserted. Finding Miguel is gonna be like looking for a needle in a hay stack.

26880:
I got sprayed in the eyes. Everything's a blur.

27360:
I could spend my life trying to get this.

27840:
What a character.

28320:
We know there's enemies present. Let's see if we can flush them out.

28800:
They're still around...somewhere. Let's not get cocky.

29760:
I just love this weapon.

30240:
He looks like momma's boy. Let's grab him.

30720:
Can't wait to see her try it, Miguel. She'll be wishing she went to beauty school when I get through with her.

31200:
Yeah, baby. That's the last of this group of losers.

31680:
How's about someone cough up the missing stuff before I start snapping heads?

32160:
Bitch. Lie still. Mind you, if she gets up, I want to shoot her again. Best thing I've done all day.

32640:
Holy litterbox!

33120:
Right on. I knew we'd see this day. I enjoyed it, too. I like this quickie, getting in and out, and not having to take back a whole country. Thanks again, for the experience.

33600:
Aw, looks like the poor widdle babies got scared and ran away. Just us here now.

34080:
I'm gonna crash for a sec. Let you know when I get back on the job.

34560:
I'm up and on it.

35040:
Hey, I said it first.

35520:
This is broken, doubt it's even worth holding.

36000:
Whoa! This baby's ready to do some damage.

36480:
I wouldn't walk near there even if it was the only way to the outhouse.

36960:
Drowning! Holy shit! Gotta get... <glub> outta here!

37440:
So tell me, what's the plan now that I'm here?

37920:
Good! With the laptop working again I don't feel quite as naked.

38400:
Holy dingleberry! That smarts!

38880:
Did the mountain jump out in front of you, flyboy?

39360:
I'm freezing my butt off. Let's get moving already.

39840:
This isn't going anywhere. I think we need a way to get into that door downstairs.

40320:
Forget it! From here on in, we're stuck with each other.

40800:
Brrrrr. My boobs feel like I'm in the frozen food section. Holy torpedo! It's cold!

41280:
There's the guard house. Let's bring the battle to them for a change.

41760:
Some paint would do wonders for this place.

42240:
Trust me, the next time I see snow it better be Christmas.

42720:
We didn't all make it. I sure hope we don't come up short later on.

43200:
Well... We have a way in, though I'm sure absolutely everybody is aware of that.

43680:
Well... I count everyone as being here. Should we move on?

44160:
That Mrs. Fung sure has a thing for rules.

44640:
Ugh! He gives me the creeps.

45120:
Blow it out your pipe, bigboy!

45600:
You realize he didn't mention anything about coming with us, did he?

46080:
If you know anything about the area you think we should know, don't be shy, Manuel.

46560:
Then, am I to belief this is the first time you change sides in mid-stream, Colonel? Would that be right, then?

47040:
Why do I get the feeling that one of us is gonna have to play babysitter?

47520:
Something tells me our trails just got a little happier. Welcome to the posse, Mr. Colburn.

48000:
This is different. I can't wait to try it out.

48480:
Ewwh! It doesn't seem very safe. I don't know...

48960:
Aww... he doesn't look so good.

49440:
Let me take a look at that letter.

49920:
Fine piece of work. You don't get to see something blow up like that every day. Heck of a nice ending to a great mission, too.

50400:
Looks like there's more than one guard house. Or maybe we got the attention of the military.

50880:
Would ya look at this. It's right out of a history book.

51360:
Looks like we took care of the cat problem. Those things were never meant to be indoors.

51840:
Wowwww! That's rich! Hahahhaaa! Ahh...Doodlehead!

52320:
Only thing not funny, is the doodlehead destroyed all his wares while blowing himself up.

52800:
Without cutters we can forget about getting through this thing quietly. Looks like I'll have to force it open.

53280:
The door's got "Nobody's Getting Through" written all over it.

53760:
Now, let's go see what just made that noise.

54240:
Sure glad I don't live around here. That noise would drive me nuts.

54720:
That's the alarm for the fan. Now's our chance.

55200:
Well... Look at this. It's the coordinates for the possible missile destinations. It's perfect! All the info we need to turn this place into a dustbowl without using explosives.

55680:
I just got to figure out how to use the control panel, then make a beeline for the elevator. Everything goes right, Deputy Commander Morris will be getting a burial like no other.
