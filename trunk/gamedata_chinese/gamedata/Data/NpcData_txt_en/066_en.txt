Freedom. Sweet freedom. I'm Greg Duncan. A survivor of Deidranna's madness.

480:
Good to see ya... I haven't forgotten ya. Doubt I ever will.

960:
I might be able to help ya.

1440:
Satan himself wouldn't last the day in a cell at Tixa.

1920:
Thanks. But I don't need it.

2400:
Hard to believe I'm finally free.

2880:
You don't scare me. There's nothing left to scare.

3360:
No! I'm thinking I should check in with my wife.

3840:
I need to get med...a doctor.

4320:
I ain't got time.

4800:
I ain't got nothing to say to you until you pay me the money you owe me.

5280:
I'm sure I can put that to use.

5760:
Could be my last chance to watch the bitch die. Yeah... I got a score to settle.

6240:
What do you say to fifty bucks a day? Something to send back to the wife and put food in my mouth along the way. I'm pretty good at jimmying doors. Could get ya into a lot of places.

6720:
I was caged up for over a month. A month longer than most people imprisoned in Tixa. They usually don't make it past the first day!

7200:
My crime? I was told to attend one of the Queen's speeches and to clap loudly. My kid got sick, and I forgot all about it. They came for me the same night.

7680:
When I told the authorities what happened, they shot and killed my four year old son right in front of me, just so it wouldn't happen again.

8160:
I know you're busy. Ya got a war to fight and all. I should be grateful just for the chance to breath air, but I'm hurtin' bad and I could use some medical attention...

8640:
Thanks. Feeling better already.

9120:
Only reason I'm probably still alive is that my brother, Matt, runs a mining operation in Alma. That was enough to make sure the guards brought me my food first. There was never enough to go around.

9600:
Matt's someone who'll be awfully glad to see me. He and his crew have been on a work slowdown at the mine in protest of my detention. Kinda slowed production as much as they could without getting themselves executed.

10080:
I'd feel better if you took care of the guards before we got into any long conversations.

10560:
Are you sure there's no one around? Last thing I'd want to do is run into a guard.

11040:
I'm up to it! I can't wait to get my hands around her neck.

11520:
Oh, what the hell... I can't pass on the chance to avenge my son's death. Just feed me every once in a while, okay?

12000:
Burn in hell! You heartless bastard.

12480:
It's good to see you too, Matt. There was a time when I thought that would never happen.

12960:
Yeah... I got a serious score to settle.
