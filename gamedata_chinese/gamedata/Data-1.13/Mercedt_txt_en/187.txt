Stumbled upon a lackey.

480:
I'm one up on an enemy. I should waste him, before turkey realizes I'm here.

960:
Got a couple of turkeys.

1440:
I'm one up on an enemy.

1920:
Had I not seen it with my own eyes, I would never have believed.

2400:
If only we had gotten here a minute sooner...

2880:
We can hear you! We know your precise location!

3360:
I'm getting an uneasy feeling.

3840:
Stay alert, I'm getting an uneasy feeling about this area.

4320:
Stay alert!

4800:
Got a couple of turkeys.

5280:
Found something over here.

5760:
Something over here.

6240:
I need a resupply of ammo.

6720:
I'm not in any pain. It's got me worried. Better send a doctor... quick.

7200:
Ah. Poor Wally. Probably never saw what hit him.

8640:
I'm puzzled.

9120:
A bullet's stuck in the chamber of my gun!

9600:
It walloped!

10080:
Aye...

10560:
Some turkey has opened fire on me!

11040:
Use the other side of your brain, laddie.

11520:
Loosing blood!

12000:
I's getting a little weary...

12480:
This heat is gonna do me in.

12960:
Child's play!

13440:
Child's play!

15360:
I want a piece of him!

15840:
This should get me some attention around here!

16320:
This heat is gonna do me in.

16800:
Great work!

17280:
This kind of stuff won't make me a legend!

17760:
A little dictator, a tyrant. Had I not seen it with my own eyes, I would never have believed what you did.

18240:
It was an experience I will take to my grave, lad.

18720:
Rather low, laddie.

19200:
Just tell me - what idiot put you in charge?

19680:
I'll tell you whatever you want to hear, just don't get me any grief over this kind of stuff.

20160:
It walloped!

20640:
This thing is a dud!

21120:
No! Its not a girdle... it's a French back and kidney supporter!

21600:
I find it strange, lad. I hear the birds - but I never see 'em.

22080:
That was quite a piece of work!

22560:
We've been had, lad. We won't be able to win this one.

23040:
Aye, don't we ever had a chance.

24480:
Granted. Old Wally can't hit the side of tenement, but he deserves to be treated batter than that.

25920:
I've wrote it all down. I'll be back to you with an answer before you know it, lad.

26400:
I've got somebody here who wants to die! I should be able to handle him.

26880:
It was downright rude!

27360:
I'm afraid not.

27840:
Ooh, you have the touch of the goddess.

28320:
Time to take off your pocket protector, laddie!

28800:
We are not planning on taking prisoners!

29280:
If luck remains with us, this one will be ours.

29760:
This should get me some attention around here!

30240:
Over here.

30720:
Are you the ringmaster of this circus?

31200:
This section belongs to us now.

31680:
We was ripped off, laddie!

32160:
It was all rather personal.

32640:
I'm one up on an enemy.

33120:
There be nothing left but the parade, lad.

33600:
Enough to teach you a lesson!

34080:
Aye.

34560:
It would be easy.

35040:
I told you!

35520:
This thing is a dud!

36000:
Booby trap! This is definitely booby trapped!

36480:
Stay alert ladies. The area appears hazardous to yer health.

36960:
Too tired... to reach shore...

37440:
I think we should get going soon.

38400:
I'm not sure I reall believe stories about what you did, but I decline anyways.

38880:
I'm afraid not. I'm feeling slightly under the weather today. It's a rather nasty virus <cough> and I've got my fingers crossed that it passes post-haste.

39360:
I was there, it was summer. The air was fresh and the landscape beautiful. And some impaired idiot had put you in charge!

39840:
I'm afraid it won't be you I'm joining, lad.

40320:
I'll be back to you with an answer before you know it, lad.

40800:
I'll get other offers, laddie. I've spent enough time with you.

42720:
I remain interested, laddie. You want me?

43200:
It's obvious you really want me, so I'll do you the favor and stick it out.

43680:
It'll be great to see some of the guys again!

44160:
Wally beats a hand, lad.

45600:
You're an impaired idiot, lad. I wouldn't repeat my last experience with you for all the tea in China!

46080:
I told you!

46560:
You be lackin' the funds, lad.

47040:
It was unexpected, but I won't hold the grudge, lad.

47520:
Don't cry for me! I'm more than happy to leave this bargain basement operation.

48000:
Wally beats a hand, lad.

50880:
I told you!

51360:
You call that an offer?

51840:
Aye, I have my ear to the information pipeline, lad. And with me on your team, you'll have your ear to it, too!

52320:
I hear things here and there, lad. For instance, I bet you didn't know Lynx and Buzz got married in the Dominican Republic last month.

52800:
So... you want to know what people say, when you're not around? Well...

53280:
I'm still unable to give you an answer, lad. With a couple of offers on the burner, I'm asking for a little something extra to engage me.

53760:
Not to ask for me again! Now I'm telling you, leave me alone!

55200:
I'll get other offers, laddie. I've spent enough time with you.

55680:
I'm going to give everyone another chance to increase my motivation for joining.
