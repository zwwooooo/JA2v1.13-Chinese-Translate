You're lucky my wife's not here!

2400:
It's despicable.

2880:
We should be extra cautious.

3360:
Things don't smell right around here.

3840:
This isn't healthy. Too much time to think.

4320:
And I could be golfing...

4800:
Encountered hostile forces!

5280:
I've come across something.

5760:
I wonder how it ended up here.

6240:
Haven't got any slugs left.

6720:
Sustained life threatening injuries... Don't know how long i've got..

7200:
Doctor Highball was a highly regarded physician, a close personal friend and a damn fine hunter.

8640:
I'm having problems.

9120:
Damn! My gun is jammed!

9600:
S.O.S.! Surgeon being shot at! I need assistance!

10080:
I'm having problems.

10560:
That was a near miss.

11040:
I'm not sure...

11520:
I'll need suturing.

I'm feeling weak.

12480:
I'm feeling weak.

12960:
It's not something I get to do often enough.

13440:
It's not something I get to do often enough.

13920:
Bald head and earring. Eliminating Skitz would not only make me happy, but society as a whole would benefit.

15360:
As a practicing physican, I recommend a prompt visit to your family doctor...

15840:
War's not supposed to be a pretty thing!

16320:
Heat's getting to me. I'm feeling weak.

16800:
I worked long enough to earn an honest pay.

17280:
Don't even bother asking me anymore.

17760:
I'd tell you to take a couple aspirins and call me in the morning. But you're not gonna be around in the morning!

18240:
I trust there will be no mention of this in my record. Actually, I insist there be no mention of this incident in any records.

18720:
Your conduct is reprehensible!

19200:
You're just fishing.

19680:
No, I won't cough for you. And your doctor jokes are getting really annoying!

20160:
And I could be golfing...

20640:
I have to get a new one. This thing doesn't work!

21120:
I'm not one to spread unsubstantiated rumours, however, I am privy to the fact that Koolhan's medical license in under investigation.

21600:
I'm a huge golfer, you know. I aced the seventeeth at Pinehurst. Yeah! And less than ideal conditions, on September 19th, 1995. You can ask Cliff Highball.

22080:
I was a doctor before I was a mercenary.

22560:
I fail to see the purpose.

23040:
And I could be golfing...

23520:
As long as Skitz is working for you, I can't stay here. The guy's unbalanced enough to be committed.

24480:
Cliff can afford to be picky - he's twice the shot that I am.

25920:
Had I been aware of your payment problems, I would've saved myself the trip down here. Now I have to go all the way back.

26400:
They'll be talking about this one in the trade papers for the years to come.

26880:
I don't believe it!

27360:
I'm not having much success.

27840:
Just so we get this straight - I'm staying for purely humanitarian reasons.

28320:
It's ours to win. We just have to be careful with this.

28800:
Perhaps you should gather your things and get out while you still can!

29760:
You just don't get the same kind of satisfaction from family practice.

30240:
Wipe that smile off your face, you think you're the first deadbeat I've come across?

30720:
I'm teeing off at nine. I have to run.

31200:
There's no question we were by far the best out there!.

31680:
At the price we paid I wish we could have gotten more!

32160:
She might require medical attention.

32640:
Have a sighting!

33120:
On behalf of all doctors everywhere - thanks! And goodbye!

33600:
We've disposed of that team.

34080:
Day is nearly over...

34560:
I'll be there shortly.

35040:
Alright, I'll repeat myself.

35520:
This thing doesn't work!

36000:
I think somebody else should handle this. My hands are important to me!

36480:
We should be extra cautious. There's fresh markings in the dirt.

36960:
I'm panicking! I... can't... catch my breath!

37440:
I'll be there before you know it!
