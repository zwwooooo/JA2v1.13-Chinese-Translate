0:
Spotted the enemy.

480:
Enemy force now in sight.

960:
Okay, time to take the gloves off.

1440:
Reporting visual confirmation of a large nauseating creature.

1920:
God almighty, look at that. Now activating involuntary gag reflex.

2400:
Evidence of a creature attack. Possible evisceration.

2880:
Detecting a suspicious sound in the vicinity.

3360:
<sniff> Nasal passages are registering a highly offensive odor, likely due to the presence of a creature.

3840:
This is a high-anxiety area. I'll attempt to compensate for decreased control of excretory functions.

4320:
No creatures in sight...but I can't shake this feeling.

4800:
These creatures from the depths of hell are starting to annoy me.

5280:
Check that out.

5760:
Something there.

6240:
My firearm requires ammunition.

6720:
These wounds are badly in need of dressing... and I want some aspirin.

7200:
Wolf was a good man and a competent soldier who died in the line of duty, as he would have wanted. Too bad there's not enough left of him to bury. Okay, that's enough.

7680:
Len was a fine warrior. I learned a lot from him, and it was an honor to serve in his company. All right, enough sentimentality.

8160:


8640:
I'm experiencing a temporary lapse of...of...something.

9120:
My gun is jammed. Requires immediate attention.

9600:
Enemy bearing down.

10080:
My wounds are minor. There should be no permanent damage.

10560:
That was close. But close doesn't count.

11040:
Tough bead to draw from here.

11520:
The flow of blood from this wound should be staunched.

12000:
I can't go on without rest. I apologize for my weakness.

12480:
Overtaxing... respiratory system. Must take a breather.

12960:
Enemy, dead.

13440:
Creature, exterminated.

13920:


14400:


14880:


15360:


15840:
I WILL suppress my nausea.

16320:


16800:
Assignment completed. Awaiting orders.

17280:
No sir.

17760:
Female target, obliterated.

18240:
The queen mother destroyed, mission accomplished. Ready to move out, sir!

18720:
It's not my place to say what I really think of that low-down scum-bucket.

19200:
I only have myself to blame for joining this miserable excuse for a team.

19680:
How did I manage to find myself on this busload of section eights?

20160:
Aerial attack! Take cover, NOW!

20640:
I don't appreciate being outfitted with factory seconds and poorly maintained equipment.

21120:
You can call me an ass, but I'm totally committed, sir. Anything you need, you ask.

21600:


22080:
There's always room for improvement.

22560:
That course of action would be foolish.

23040:
That was a lapse of leadership, sir.

23520:


24000:


24480:
Yet another example of Wolf's fine work.

24960:
Len should be mercenary of the year.

25440:


25920:
I've learned that you haven't kept current with your payments. I tend not to have a forgiving nature when putting my life on the line. Therefore, I'm tendering my resignation effective immediately.

26400:


26880:
Bad news! I've lost visuals.

27360:
This is embarrassing, sir, but I'm unable to do it.

27840:
An upstanding citizen.

28320:
I have ascertained an enemy presence, sir.

28800:
Enemies remain alive, sir, though they have proved difficult to locate.

29280:


29760:
It was nothing.

30240:
It's that disrespectful teenager, sir. In my opinion, the boy suffers from absent father syndrome. Nothing a good strapping wouldn't cure, sir.

30720:
Sir. An honorable discharge, I am assuming.

31200:
Enemy presence eliminated, sir.

31680:
There is a higher volume of air in this box than I expected. I believe something is missing.

32160:
I choose to offer no opinion on killing that useless flab of flesh, other than I believe it was fully justified, sir.

32640:
Highly aggressive feline!

33120:
Every job worth doing is worth doing well, and we did it very well. It has been my pleasure and honor to serve you, sir, and as such, I should hope that you will consider me for future assignments.

33600:
The enemies have retreated, sir.

34080:
I must rest to maintain optimum performance level. I will sleep now.

34560:
Awake and back to maximum efficiency.

35040:
Copy that.

35520:
Poor equipment gives poor results. This is not pleasant.

36000:
Halt! Booby trap detected.

36480:
Caution! Chance to severely hurt ourselves over there, sir.

36960:
Water deeper than anticipated, sir, and causing substantial buoyancy problems.

37440:
Destination achieved, sir.
