I am Raul. I have borrowed this warehouse, so you and I might conduct some business. Heh heh.

480:
Look... Look who's here.

960:
I don't need no friends.

1440:
Was there anything else?

1920:
Keep it!

2400:
This going to be long?

2880:
Are you threatening me?

3360:
In your dreams, and I doubt even there.

3840:
Don't just stand there! I'm bleeding!

4320:
Feel free to get on with your business.

4800:
Relax! I not show you what I got.

5280:
Tell me what you want, man.

5760:
I got other places to be, eh?

6240:
What are you doing? Window shopping?

6720:
You want to make exchange huh, is this right?

7200:
You want to sell this stuff to me? I must be psychic...

7680:
Let me have a good look.

8160:
I am armsdealer. I don't want to deal in anything else.

8640:
You can keep it, uh? It has no value to me!

9120:
That is stuff that I'll never be able to sell... unless it is really dark. I can't do better.

9600:
We can make arrangement.

10080:
Though you are a little short on the trade-in.

10560:
We are finished here. Unless you want something else.

11040:
You got a good deal. I even give you money.

11520:
Finished. I might be in here when you need me again.

12000:
You waste my time.

12480:
Hey, you! Don't you want to take it.

12960:
Too bad. I can only carry so much.

13440:
You are more close to death than you know! I will laugh at the remains of your body when I am finished. Ha! You will die now!

13920:
I just come from Arulco where I purchase many fine weapons to add to my selection. There was some sort of war there, or something. You are interested in doing some business?

14400:
I be in town for a some time meeting contacts. If I don't got what you want now, maybe I can get it soon.

14880:
I have nothing new, but I work on it.

15360:
You are threatening me! You are crazy! You do not who you threaten. Nobody threatens Raul! Nobody! I mean nobody! Who are you that you think you can threaten Raul, eh? A buffoon full of threats?

15840:
You are this close - this close to getting me mad. You have nerve threatening me like this. You got nerve, but you are stupid. I should slap your stupid head. Slap your brain from side of head to other.

16320:
You buffoon, stupid person, you make me mad. You do not want to offend me, because I will not stand here and be threatened by you. Do you understand this? Do I make myself clear? Now, don't threaten me no more!

16800:
Oh, now you got me mad. How many times I tell you not to threaten me? Five? Six? Seven, eh? But you no want to listen. You no want to listen to me tell you not to threaten me. You just go on and on, and on, and on.

17280:
You think you are tough, uh? You think you are big soldier with SMALL BRAIN. You think you can just threaten Raul as many times as you want? You do not understand who you are threatening. Raul needs to teach you some respect!

17760:
This is coming. I tell you, but you probably don't listen. You too busy thinking of what to threaten next to listen. But you will learn. You will learn the hard way. This is a promise I make.

18240:
What??? What??? It is not possible. Now, you have done it. You have threatened me for the last time. You were warned. I told you many, many time, but no, you continue as if I never told you nothing.

18720:
Who you think you are? You think I fear you? You think your threats bother me? Well... You not thinking right. You think like you listen, bad, very bad. You are stupid person with your hard head and mouth full of threats.

19200:
And you are going to pay for talking this way and not listening. I will show you mistake you make. You are threatening Raul. And you will feel pain for this. Great pain. Pain you do not even know yet!

19680:
It will be mistake you will not make again. Never! Never in your life will you threaten me again. I hope you are listening now, eh? I will kill you before I say it again. This is final!

20160:
The walking waste of time!

20640:
A person full of threats. A person who tries to make Raul scared with talk. Huh! I am not afraid of you. You are nothing!

21120:
That's much better. I did not want to kill you. Well... maybe a little bit.

21600:
That's better. Next time be quicker.

22080:
You want to sell to Raul. I look for special antique weapon for collector. Eighteen century, hand mortar. It is a very rare piece, man, but I know there is one in town of Varrez. We can make arrangement.

22560:
I notice the way you look at the Barrett M82A2. I make you a special price on this weapon. I give you discount of fifty percent - if you find me the hand mortar. Eh? It's the most generous offer. Think about it!

23040:
You are resourceful. I hope owner of the hand mortar didn't ask too much. Gun's condition is not important. Owners' condition is not important either. Give me everything you want to sell, huh? We make a deal.

23520:
Do not taunt me, eh! I have no patience for games!

24000:
Okay! This the best I can do. Do not enrage me!

24480:
Just like I promise I cut price of Barrett in half to show my appreciation. It would be smart to take advantage, huh? It's an excellent sniper rifle.

24960:
Take care of your business. When the shooting stops, we take care of our business.
