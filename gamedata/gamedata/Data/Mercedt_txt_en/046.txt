0:
Have a sighting.

480:
I've got... I have located the presence of a grunt, sir.

960:
This is all too real, man.

1440:
Flashback!

1920:
Looks like it's from an evil swamp or something, sir.

2400:
Those swamp insects are real serious.

2880:
Who made that noise?

3360:
That's disgusting. Smells like swamp gas.

3840:
Buckle up! I gotta... I have concerns about the road ahead.

4320:
My swamp creature sensors are primed, sir.

4800:
Kinda wish this was all mushroom induced, man.

5280:
There's something.

5760:
Found something.

6240:
Gonna need a resupply of ammo.

6720:
Oh, this is considerably more painful straight.

7200:
Poor Biff. He was so young, so misunderstood. He was the only guy who would give me a ninth chance at proving myself. I'm gonna miss his little redhead.

8160:
Ah, man... Somehow, I knew Flo wouldn't survive this cutthroat life. But she put a smile on Biffy's face, so I said nothing.

8640:
I seemed to have had a brain relapse, sir. They told me that would happen.  What's up?

9120:
Bullet's stuck!

9600:
How's a guy supposed to stay sober?

10080:
I deserved that.

10560:
Could be a good night for poker...

11040:
Even with sober vision, that shot's difficult, sir.

11520:
Need to be bandaged! And I need a... just a little... ah, taste of Demerol.

12000:
Put in a good shift, man... uh, sir. Need some winks.

12480:
Two packs a day too many, sir. Need a breather.

12960:
You were, now you ain't.

13440:
You're tuna bait!

13920:
Static's a loser. He was a bad influence on me, sir. Can't stand being around him anymore.

14400:
That Ruthless Reuban is one real frightening dude! I don't think I want to go into battle with him, man.

14880:
I don't want to be a squealer, but that Steroid is on drugs, sir. It ain't good for me to be around people on dope. At least that's what my counselor says.

15360:
I can't watch Steroid do drugs anymore, man. It's just too hard. I gotta leave.

15840:
And people ask me why I did drugs?

16800:
I'm all done.

17280:
Not as long as I got... have a clear head on my shoulders, sir.

17760:
I told everyone I'd do her.

18240:
Nothing will ever haunt me again.

18720:
I'd like to put that loser through a twelve-step program. First step has my heel smack in his forehead.

19200:
Being straight is a real drag... Everything is, like, so predictable.

19680:
I miss the old group. Guys like Reuban, Smoke, Skitz, Vinny and Tex. Man, I miss Tex.

20160:
Incoming!

20640:
I bet they were giving me the shit stuff for years. I just didn't realize it.

21120:
I'd really like to get to know some of these guys better.

22080:
Credit a clear head, sir.

22560:
Don't think we're thinking this out.

23040:
Figured as much, man...uh, sir.

23520:
Static's wearing me down. I gotta... I have to get out of here before I give in to his influence.

24000:
Sorry man, but Unusually Ruthless Reuban is like a little too scary for me! Either you cut him loose, or I'm headed back to the lab, man!

24480:
Biff's gonna be a fine merc someday.

25440:
You gotta watch out for the shy, quiet types. They always surprise ya.

25920:
Gotta go! Speck wants to see me. Something about a bill that hasn't been paid.

26880:
This ain't cool! I can't open my eyes!

27360:
I think I should just forget it, sir.

27840:
She turned out to be all right, sir.

28320:
There are grunts...uh, enemies present around here, sir.

28800:
The area isn't clean yet, sir. I'd advise caution.

29280:
I know I'm excited, sir.

30240:
It's that little shi...uh...missing child, sir.

30720:
Let go, let God, sir. I'm clean, serene and mean, and if you need me again, just call. I needed a meeting anyway.

31200:
The area's all clean, man... sir.

31680:
Man, looks like some stuff's missing. Ya got insurance, huh, sir?

32160:
Sometimes 'Live and Let Live' just doesn't cut it, sir.

32640:
Easy does it, man!

33120:
I just want to say that I'm grateful, sir, to everyone and to my Higher Power. It was tough, but we all did it one day at a time. Man... do I want to get shit-faced! Uh, just kiddin'...

33600:
The grunts have moved on, sir.

34080:
Sack time helps me to perform better, sir, and I need some. I'll be up making coffee before you know it.

34560:
I just knocked back some coffee and I'm ready to go, sir... Think I might be addicted to that stuff.

35040:
Me too, sir.

35520:
Time to put this thing in the shop, sir.

36000:
Whoa... It looks like a booby trap, sir.

36480:
Man, uh, sir, I believe this area could be dangerous.

36960:
I'm... going... under... water... sir... Need... ass...istance... like... now... man...

37440:
Like, I'm all here now, man, uh sir.
