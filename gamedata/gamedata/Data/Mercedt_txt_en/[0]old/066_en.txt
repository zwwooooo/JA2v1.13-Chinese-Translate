Soldiers.

480:
I knew they weren't too far.

960:
I need help. Fast!

1440:
Hellbug!

1920:
Holy Toledo! I heard of 'em, but I ain't never seen one...'til now.

2400:
There was a rumor that Deidranna had a way of disposing bodies so they'd never be found. I got a feeling those Hellbugs are involved.

2880:
What made that noise?

3360:
That's the same odor I smelled in the prison.

3840:
I'm feeling uncomfortable. Need to keep my head...

4320:
Those Hellbugs better be sleeping.

4800:
Hellbugs! All over the place.

5280:
Something there.

5760:
Might be useful...

6240:
I ain't got any bullets left.

6720:
Don't look good... Don't think I'll get my chance at revenge. Tell my wife I'm sorry about our son. I pray she forgives me.

7200:
I liked Shank. He'd come a long way from that spoiled rich kid who showed up that night in Tixa. Even gave him his nickname. Breeham would have got him killed in there.

8160:
Gonna miss Blood. Can't say I knew him a long time, but I liked what I knew.

8640:
Mind was in Tixa for a minute. Give me it again.

9120:
Something's wrong! Gun won't fire.

9600:
It's rainin' bullets.

10080:
I've had worse done to me while I slept.

10560:
You don't hit me, you don't scare me.

11040:
I can barely see it!

11520:
They took a chunk outta me. Probably need bandaging.

12000:
I'm spent. Looking to sack out a bit.

12480:
Lung capacity ain't what it was...

12960:
See ya.

13440:
Buzz off!

14880:
That animal Bubba is an ignorant S.O.B. Wish someone would just shoot him.

15840:
Make your stomach turn.

16320:
Gonna get that broad Deidranna. Ain't nothin' gonna stand in my way but death.

16800:
I'm finished. I'm ready.

17280:
I'm not into it right now.

17760:
That was for my son, you Nazi bitch! May the devil reject your soul.

18240:
Got the momma!

18720:
Dunghead.

19200:
Things ain't goin' right. Maybe I should go at this myself.

19680:
Don't trust nobody. I know, I was born in this country.

20160:
Those planes are headed right for us.

20640:
I guess it's part of the pecking order. The local guy gets the crap supplies.

21120:
Wish we'd pick up the pace. I got a date with Deidranna.

21600:
I hate to put a whole group of people in one despicable bunch. But every Hungarian who ever stepped into Arulco has caused nothing but trouble.

22080:
I'm gettin' better.

22560:
Haven't got a clue what that's gonna accomplish.

23040:
Stuff like that scares me.

24480:
You've done good, Shank!

25440:
Liking you more every day, Blood.

25920:
Hey! Where's my money?

26400:
I wasn't asking for much. Just a couple of bucks worth of respect. See ya. I'd rather take a go at her myself.

26880:
Burnt my eyes! Can't see nothing!

27360:
I just can't do it.

27840:
A sympathizer.

28320:
There's soldiers buzzin' around.

28800:
Deidranna's soldiers are still around. I won't rest 'til we get 'em all.

29760:
Packs a punch!

30240:
That's Mrs. Graham's boy. I'd give anything to have mine back.

30720:
That wasn't part of the plan. I got business with Deidranna.

31200:
They're all out of their misery. Though I wouldn't mind killing another one.

31680:
Didn't figure on this. Someone's looting our supplies. I'd put my money on Pablo. I've heard he's got connections to the black market.

32160:
I can't stand to see someone abuse children. She wasn't Deidranna, but she was too close for comfort.

32640:
Prison rat!

33120:
This isn't about me, you understand. This is about my son. You might not ever know the peace I feel right now, but let me tell you, you're a major part of it.

33600:
Damn it! They got away. Left us to do as we please.

34080:
I'm hitting the sack. Be up in a few.

34560:
I'm punched in.

35040:
Yeah, I'm in the same way.

35520:
Can't afford to have this happen. It needs to be fixed.

36000:
This is just waiting to blow someone up.

36480:
Look closely... It's got "trouble" written all over it.

36960:
No... no... tell my wife.. I... I... died... trying...

37440:
I'm waiting on new orders here.
