Got one, eh.

480:
They're popping out the woodwork, eh.

960:
Getting hammered, eh!

1440:
Got one, eh.

1920:
Maybe, uh, I should just blow it open.

2400:
That hurt, eh.

2880:
What, dude?

3360:
I... seem to be having a little trouble, eh.

3840:
Bad news, eh.

4320:
We gotta be finished soon, eh.

4800:
Getting hammered, eh!

5280:
Looks like there's something over here, eh.

5760:
Looks like there's something over here, eh.

6240:
How about some ammo, eh?

6720:
This ain't no joke, eh. I'm... bleeding like a goat here...

9120:
Bloody bullet's stuck, eh. I can't fire my weapon.

9600:
I'm being shot at over here, eh!

10080:
I'm sweating like a pig.

10560:
By the skin of my teeth, eh.

11040:
I can't even see 'em, eh.

11520:
Oh, god blood running down me, eh.

12000:
I'm still out, swollen up like a melon, eh.

12480:
I'm sweating like a pig.

12960:
First time, eh!

13440:
First time, eh!

15360:
Wasn't easy, eh.

15840:
So... who cut your hair, eh?

16800:
What do you want, eh?

17280:
Kinda stupid, eh.

17760:
I wish I could tell the difference but... she's dead? Must've just happened, she's still giving off heat.

18240:
You better hurt, eh.

18720:
What a looser.

19200:
I've had enough. You're just playing with me, eh.

19680:
We're pretty great, eh?

20160:
I... seem to be having a little trouble, eh.

20640:
Like... you're too cheap, eh.

21120:
You must be capricorn, eh?

22080:
The next offer better involve money printed on paper.

22560:
I hope it's the right thing to do, eh.

23040:
That was no deal. We got taken to the cleaners, eh.

25920:
I don't think money's gonna change anything, eh.

26400:
Oh, we're really scared over here, eh.

26880:
It's like I'm seeing you in a whole new light, eh.

27360:
I gave it a shot, eh, but explosives are my specialty.

27840:
I like what you've done with your hair, eh.

28320:
I'm keeping quiet, eh. That way no one knows I'm here.

28800:
Where are they hiding, eh?

29280:
We're gonna have to get it back?

30240:
I wonder what's ese's doing here?

30720:
As far as the mission goes, eh, we are lucky.

31200:
He he, that's one bunch wiped out, eh!

31680:
Bad news, eh.

32160:
We've done what we had to do, eh.

32640:
Got one, eh.

33120:
The only thing left to do is... party, eh!

33600:
We almost done it, eh.

35040:
Oh, it's nice for you to inquire.

35520:
This thing's seen better days, eh.

36000:
Those jerks wired this thing, eh.

36480:
Slow, eh, on this loose turf. It's getting me the witties.

36960:
I... I'm gonna need help... I can't swim much longer!

37440:
Sorry for the delay, eh, but I'm all set now.

38400:
I don't mean to throw the last cupple of missions in your face but who wouldn't, eh?

38880:
Your guys have more led in them, er, than a pencil, eh.

39360:
Forget it, eh. Last time I signed with you, you canned me.

39840:
I just had my wisdom teeth out, eh.

40320:
Bad news, eh. Seems to be run on explosive experts.

40800:
I'd rather go back on social assistance than stay here and try to get in with working with a team that's changing all the time, eh.

42720:
Let me know how it turns out, eh?

43200:
Alright. Let's stick around for now, eh.

43680:
I can't wait to get there, eh.

45600:
I'm leaving, eh. I might come back when you shake this looser thing, eh.

46080:
I told you hosehead...

46560:
I'm gonna have to see the cash, eh.

47040:
See you hosehead. This kind of cash is going to get me one hell of a 'lonely man weekend', eh, he he.

47520:
Hey mister death, eh, I'm outta here.

50880:
I told you hosehead...

51360:
I'm gonna have to see the cash, eh.

51840:
I'm listening, eh.

52320:
All the guys like me, eh. I usually entertain them with a couple of tricks I know, eh, that make use of small explosions.

52800:
What's the deal, eh?

53280:
It's gonna be fun working for you, eh.

53760:
I get back to yous, eh.

55200:
You're gonna have to dig deeper, eh.

55680:
Bad news for you, great news for me, eh. If you want me to join, eh, it's gonna cost you more.
