0:
Target.

480:
It's time to spring into action.

960:
This isn't going smoothly! I need help!

1440:
Copepods!

1920:
Oh my God! That's... well, phylum Arthropoda, class Crustacea, but... what are they? Krill? Brine shrimp? Copepods? Jesus, I think they ARE Copepods... only a few thousand times their usual size!

2400:
If I had to venture a guess, I'd say this was evidence of a copepod attack. Something you usually only see through a microscope.

2880:
What was that? I just heard a noise.

3360:
<sniff> Decomposition... bile... those Copepods are the only creatures large enough to create a stink this fetid.

3840:
If instinct counts for anything, we're stepping into something bad.

4320:
Wish I had some huge plankton-eating fish with me to keep those Copepods away.

4800:
They're all around me! What the hell do I do?

5280:
Could be important.

5760:
Let's see that.

6240:
Oh shoot, no ammo.

6720:
I don't... want to die... in this hellhole.

8160:
Danny, you made meatball surgery look like... poetry in motion. If I could only be half as good as you were. I really wish it hadn't been you...

8640:
Sorry, I'm drawing a blank. What do I do again?

9120:
It's jammed, my gun is jammed. Perfect.

9600:
This is looking bad!

10080:
They never mentioned that in the brochure.

10560:
I'm... sure... it wasn't as close as it looked.

11040:
Doubt I can make that from here.

11520:
Uh, need some time to stop the bleeding.

12000:
I gotta sleep. I didn't do these kind of hours even when I was an intern.

12480:
I'm all out of breath.

12960:
One for our side.

13440:
Tag 'em and bag 'em.

15360:
Mike was the most revered man in all of AIM. I can't believe I killed him. Me!

15840:
That's the most horrible thing I've ever seen.

16320:
The heat in this place is driving me crazy. And the humidity is unbelievable.

16800:
Looking for something to do.

17280:
I won't do that. I'm sorry, but... no.

17760:
I guess there's a little bit of Kevorkian in all of us!

18240:
Whaddaya know? I'm macho! Officially, macho!

18720:
What a putz.

19200:
This is nothing like I imagined it would be. I thought it'd be, y'know, bearable.

19680:
These macho freaks were amusing to be around for, like, the first ten minutes.

20160:
Planes, coming in!

20640:
There's only so much I can do with equipment like this. And it ain't much.

21120:
I gotta keep believing there's a light at the end of this tunnel.

22080:
I may make a career out of this after all.

22560:
For what it's worth, I don't think that has a chance of working.

23040:
I knew that would never work.

25440:
See, I had a good feeling about Danny, and I was right!

25920:
I might be willing, but let's wait a little longer to see how well this works out. Nothing personal, just being cautious.

26400:
Is that Mike? Oh my God, it is!

26880:
Oh my God! I've lost the benefit of sight.

27360:
I wish I could do this, but it doesn't seem likely.

27840:
You can run into some rather interesting people down here.

28320:
The enemy is present in the area.

28800:
We should be mindful of the ones that are still nearby.

29280:
All right! I've never found anything this valuable.

30240:
I think we found the runaway teenager.

30720:
We are pleased to come to your aid, Miguel. The situation certainly requires our intensive care.

31200:
Whaddaya know! They're all dead!

31680:
If I recall correctly, we ordered more than this...

32160:
I'm supposed to save lives, not take them... and in this case, I believe we saved a great many. She got the medicine she deserved.

32640:
Tranquilizer time!

33120:
Well, whaddya know! We did it! Wow, I learned more here than I did in the emergency room, trauma and ICU combined... and I owe it all to you. Look, you need any surgery, call me, and I'll do it for free.

33600:
The enemies have gone into remission. We're alone.

34080:
These intern hours are killing me. I'll take a rest and be up for the next shift.

34560:
It was exactly what the doctor ordered. I'm back on the job.

35040:
Yes, me too.

35520:
Great. This stuff breaks more often than collar bones.

36000:
Careful, careful. This is trapped.

36480:
I would urge extreme caution. That looks suspect to me.

36960:
Someone.... save my ass... STAT!

37440:
I'm on site. Where do I go from here...

38400:
Oh, I've heard about the way you run things. I don't think I'm up for that kind of grief. At least not this early in my career.

38880:
I'm not your man. I want to get more experience but with your survival rate, I'll never get the chance to put that experience to use.

39360:
I'm really sorry. My research paper's being published in Lancet, and I want to be around for the publicity.

39840:
Oh, I can't. I'm assisting in a combination heart and lung transplant at Mount Sinai, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

40320:
This is Michael Dawson, M.D. I'm probably seeing patients right now, so if you leave a message, I'll call you right back. Thanks.

40800:
This was great. I learned a lot. Thanks for giving me a chance.

42720:
I'll tell ya, my time's just about over. Can I convince you to extend my contract?

43200:
Great. This is working out just the way I'd hoped.

43680:
You got it. I'll be there with bells on.

45120:
Are you kidding? I'd give my right arm to see Danny in action. He's incredible. So yeah, in spite of your... I mean, yeah!

45600:
I'm sorry. After what we've been through, I'm thinking I may not be cut out for this kind of work. I'm going to have to do some soul-searching for a while.

46080:
Listen carefully...

46560:
Apparently, I'm beyond your means.

47040:
Was it something I said? Something I did? Or didn't do? Never mind, you don't owe me any explanations. I'll go.

47520:
I'm not your man. I want to get more experience, but with your survival rate, I'll never get the chance to put that experience to use.

50400:
Are you kidding? I'd give my right arm to see Danny in action. He's incredible. So yeah, in spite of your... I mean, yeah.

50880:
Listen carefully...

51360:
Apparently, I'm beyond your means.

51840:
Michael Dawson, MD.

52320:
I know I'm a little green as far as field work, but just put a scalpel in my hand and watch my smoke.

52800:
I'm waiting.

53280:
How long a contract is this going to be?

53760:
Fine. If you don't know what you want, don't waste my time.

55200:
Been thinking, you know, my time's just about up here.

55680:
Nothing personal, but I was thinking that since my skills have improved, a raise in my fees might just be appropriate.
