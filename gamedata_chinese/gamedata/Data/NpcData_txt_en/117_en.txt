I'm Hans. How can I help you?

480:
You are becoming a regular...

960:
How's about massage oils? Got my whole exotic fruit collection slashed to half price.

1440:
Have I told you about our giant video clearance? Buy any rubber item in the store, and get your choice of video cassette free.

1920:
Keep it! I can barely unload the stuff I've got.

2400:
I got this great idea for a new marketing campaign: Make love, not war. Not original, but pretty in tune with the situation. Maybe I put your photo on the flyer.

2880:
The S&M stuff is in the corner.

3360:
I've got a business to run.

3840:
Ah... This is no joke.

4320:
I got to take inventory. If you're in the neighborhood, come back again.

4800:
Good. Relief with my creditors. Maybe now, the Good Vibrations Company will finally send me new stock.

5280:
It's pay back time, ya twisted schnook.

5760:
Bet you're here to see Tony, right? He's in back.

6240:
Tony stepped out for a bit. You'll have to come back later if you're looking to see him.

6720:
Just maybe if you brought back some of the ones you took, the shelves wouldn't look so empty!

7200:
For the tenth time, they're all back ordered. You've been in here for over two hours. You got three films to choose from. Let's step it up.

7680:
Oh, geez! Who's gonna clean up the mess? Look what you've done. I've cleaned up a lot of things in this place...mostly small messes. This one's gonna take all day.

8160:
Finally... I got to put up with her crap every other day. Always the same story, nuthin' but complaints. Wish I still had my bike shop, but that business went belly up when the Queen cut off the fuel supply.

8640:
Okay... Now that she's out of the way. I got a feeling you aren't here to buy marital aids. Tony is in the back. I'm sure you'll be satisfied with his selection.

9120:
You will have to step it up. It's closing time.

9600:
Man, I tell ya, this woman is a pest.

10080:
I don't know why I put up with her. Wish all my customers were like that kid I had in earlier. Bought every porno magazine on the rack. That little punk with an earring was loaded with cash.

10560:
Don't know what he was planning on doing with them, but the last time I  saw him, he was headed out of town towards the abandoned mine.

11040:
Ya... As I recall, he might have been wearing a blue jacket and a yellow shirt.

11520:
How about we talk after the crossfire?
