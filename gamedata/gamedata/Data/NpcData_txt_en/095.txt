Well... who have we here?

480:
Look who the cat dragged in.

960:
So uh, you're a soldier...

1440:
The country is beautiful this time of year, don't you think?

1920:
Well... thank you, but I'm already spoken for. I can't be taking gifts from just anyone.

2400:
My...aren't we the hurried one.

2880:
If you're trying to excite me with your forcefulness, it's working.

3360:
Me? A mercenary? Oh, I don't think so... I am an artiste.

3840:
Oh... ah... ah... the PAIN!

4320:
I'm so sorry, but you'll have to come back another time.

4800:
I'll be sure to put this in my tip jar.

5280:
Look at those muscles... I bet you work out... Everything looks so tight.

5760:
So many big burly men... And it's not even my birthday.

6240:
I hope you're not here to get an eagle on your shoulder. Simply everybody wants the eagle. Boring, boring, boring...they're so passe.

6720:
The moment I saw you, I saw wild peacock. A vibrant multi-colored peacock spreading its feathers of manhood across your...right buttock. Dancing euphoric, yet sitting determined, declaring its presence.

7200:
It won't hurt a bit... I promise.

7680:
I won't be doing tattoos forever, you know. No, my big burly man, Kyle Lemmons will one day be the proprietor of his own leather boutique... with custom embroidery done by you know who... Kyle Lemmons - artiste.

8160:
That's why I am renting this place from Mr. Klaus. I've had my left eye on that leather shop in town, but there's just no convincing that cute little Angel to sell. Oh, maybe one day...my dreams will come true.

8640:
Oh, my...oh, my...stop my panting heart! The deed to Angel's leather shop. Can it be? Why, yes... of course I'll buy it from you. I'll give you everything I have for it.

9120:
Here you go... ten thousand dollars. Oh, I can't believe this! I will never, ever, forget you. You made my dreams come true. You sweetheart, you.

9600:
I don't mean to be pushy... but I'll have to close the shop soon. I have to rush off home to feed my pussycats.

10080:
You raving lunatic, you. You...you bully!

10560:
Oh! Oh! Oh my! What? Talk now? Are you crazy?
